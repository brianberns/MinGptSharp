# MinGptSharp

A minimal ~~PyTorch~~ F# .NET TorchSharp re-implementation of the OpenAI GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)
training based on Andrej Karpathy's [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT). I've attempted to follow
his general structure, but with a functional approach and my own comments.
