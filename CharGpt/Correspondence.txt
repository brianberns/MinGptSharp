Correspondence: 1985 – 1995
Introduction
Dear Lisa,
Our correspondence is a treasure, so I decided to collect it all in one place. I’m including every letter I have through 1995, even the ones I decided not to send at the time. Some of what I wrote makes me cringe now, but I’ve decided it’s better to include everything for history’s sake.
love,
Brian

Brian,
       No, this card has no hidden birthday message, in fact, it has no message at all. I never was one for conventionalities. This is supposed to be your last teenage year but I know you’ll be a teenager in spirit forever. But have a great last year anyway.
       Just to make sure you do, the next bottle of tequila is on me… Happy Birthday!
Love,
Lisa

This is the birthday card you gave me when I turned 19 at the beginning of junior year. Tequila symbolized the bond we had made as sophomores. I like how you established right off the bat that our correspondence wasn’t going to be conventional.

August 5, 1986 – From Lisa
1:00 AM.
Dear Brian,
	Insomnia has a grip on me, and all because I know that I have to get up early and I have no alarm clock. I’ve been thinking about writing to you since I arrived in Sweden and have put it off this long because of all the difficulties and weirdnesses of things said and things unsaid. I don’t like to have to weigh everything that I say, so I won’t. The weirdness bothers me. And the inevitability of the weirdness bothers me even more. I thought a lot about that you said when we had that long talk and there was so much of it that I did not and still do not want to accept. But being the mutable, practical earth sign that I (we) am, I can deal. I just hope that when we are together we can just enjoy being together without there being a shadow. And no tension. I hate tension. I went to the beach Memorial weekend (D.C.) with Kevin (from Brown) and Angela (from home) and talk about tension… Those two just didn’t hit it off. They didn’t break into blows but it was almost worse that it never really came out. And I felt bad because I didn’t want to take sides, I just wanted peace and harmony. It was a good weekend despite the personality clashes. The best was sleeping out on the dunes one night. My first night ever out under the stars. I loved it! Anyway, after the beach I spent some time at home then went to Princeton to see my sister – graduation, etc. That was fun. Very little sleep, lots of parties, long talks w/ Margaret. It was great to spend some time w/ her again. I went up Friday and my parents came Sunday, so we had a couple days unfettered. After my parents go there – more tension, mostly because of their deafness. Very difficult in those types of social affairs… After Princeton, it was N.Y. where I saw Karen and Dave. (his was the last familiar face I saw on U.S. soil.) Karen was here, did you know that? For a week and a half she stayed with me, which was great fun. My, goodness, I don’t like condensing, but it’s been so long. Maybe I should wait ‘til I see you. I’m a mess of ideas and impressions and unsettled experiences right now, anyway. I think I’ll have to wait a while before I can really say what my impression is of this summer. I need to distance myself from it to see what I’ve gotten out of it. It’s been a good experience, strange, at times. It took me a while to realize that I was actually here. I hope your summer has been, what should I say? – Letters can be so ineffectual. But I didn’t want you to think that I hadn’t thought about you all summer. I’m coming home in a few days. Maybe we can get together. Take care, Bri. Here’s a hug, which can’t be weird.
Love,
Lisa

This letter was written during the summer before senior year. I have no distinct recollection of the “weirdness” it mentions, but I don’t think it ended up being very serious.
My favorite line from this letter is “I don’t like to have to weigh everything that I say, so I won’t”. This told me that you were going to write from the heart, and I tried to do the same.


 
August 12, 1986 – From Brian
2:00 am
Dear Lisa,
	This is my third attempt at a letter back to you. The first one was labeled 1:40 am, and the second one was 1:45 am. I got a half page into that one before it suddenly occurred to me that I sounded like an idiot. So here I am at 2:00 frustrated and incompetent. I seem to have developed this tread recently wherein I write terribly egotistical letters full of descriptions of how terrible I think my letters are. It’s strange. As a letter writer, perhaps my best days are behind me.
	Well, regardless of that crap, thank you for writing me. It is good to know you are thinking of me, as events here often lead me to think of you in Sweden in another world. You are so different from me that it is somehow easier to picture you around the world, up late writing a letter to me than it is to picture you in a house in Silver Spring, MD with Peter [Fiori]’s guitar. It is tempting to apologize to you for the state things are in. I wish I could just say “no more weirdness” and everything would be fine, but I guess that won’t work. As our friendship has usually been drowned out in the general chaos of David, Jeff, and Peter, I think that it just might take a little time for us to trust each other as much as we’d like. I hope you never thought I didn’t care for you or anything, because I certainly do. Maybe we should get together and talk about things again, and this time talk about you and me, instead of just letting me complain about you. Frequently, my complaints are the purest of bullshit, and I have no business stating them or demanding change due to them. Ask Sue Dimmock, I’m sure she’ll agree.
	Anyway, Jeffy tells me you spent the night in NY. That must have been interesting. I hope things were pleasant.
	Things here have been pretty good. I stopped work a week after more or less going insane over this computer program. It wasn’t worth it. At least I made some money. These days I just hang around, play racquetball with Pete, and go absolutely bonkers over the new R.E.M. album during the day when my parents work. It’s a life. I’ve been to see Jeff in NY with Evan once. It was a lot of fun. I miss them both a lot, really. Sue and I have been talking regularly over the phone. Things have been great between us for about a month or so. I guess that means we’ll be frantic with anger again by the time school start. It never ever ends, that’s one thing I’ve learned.
	I guess I’ll be seeing you pretty soon. Brown is a terrible place to have a friendship. I hate the way it distorts everything. Oh well. I guess that’s what tequila’s for, really.
love
Brian
P.S. See HEARTBURN now.


It was harder for me to put my unfiltered thoughts on paper, because they were often dark or felt inappropriate. I ended up writing a lot of stuff that I couldn’t bear to send you afterwards.
As before, I don’t remember what the actual “weirdness” discussed in this letter is. I think we were just trying to work out the terms of a friendship that felt right for both of us. Three of my close friends already had romantic feelings for you, which made things complicated and a bit ridiculous. I think it frustrated you that men often approached you that way, instead of actually getting to know you. I resolved not to make that mistake.
Did Brown really make friendships difficult, or was it just me? I think the atmosphere there in the 80’s was not as warm as it is today, but I’m not sure it actually distorted things. In any case, I didn’t find it to be a supportive environment, even though I adored the friends I was making.



1987
July 22, 1987 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
This ribbon is awfully pale and my typing is awfully bad but I’m going to give it a go since I’m beginning to feel lost without a typewriter. Well. So you got an address and I didn’t get a post card. Hmmmmmmm. Just kidding, I was just using a little of the Jewish Jay Guilt Technique. After being victimized so often by it I’ve learned how to imitate it but not very well, not as well as the master himself. Ooh I’m so mean. Can you tell from my tone that I’ve broken up with Jay? I guess you may have seen it coming after all my bitching and whining about the way things were. Well all of sudden I realized that I knew all these things deep down that I just wasn’t listening to. And that I hadn’t been listening to myself in a very long time which was very bad. This all happened the weekend of the fourth of July when Kira Mary and Tahir were here. I think talking to Mary and Tahir was what I needed to shock me into realization. I had the best weekend and you don’t know what an exhilarating feeling it was once I decided to break up with Jay. Even before I actually did it I felt so free and happy. The actual deed was not so pleasant nor was being called a cunt. The end was typical of the whole. I told Jay why I had to have freedom and that I was finally paying attention to my needs instead of his and all he had to say was I understand your needs but you Promised  me you’d come down this weekend and I’m counting on you to come. I think the problem was that we were too different. Beyond being different enough to learn from each other and be stimulated by our differences. Beyond that into lack of a basic understanding of each other. I had a talk with Tahir right before I took him to the airport and at the end I felt like crying and I didn’t know why. Later I realized that it was because he had understood me so easily and so clearly and that hadn’t happened in such a long time. Sad. But now all is well and I’m happy. I feel like I can start to grow again. No more worrying about how I might hurt Jay by the things I do. He had the nerve to call me up a while after we broke up and ask me if I had gone out with or messed around with anyone else. Anyway. That was the best thing that has happened to me all summer that realization. Since then things have calmed clown a little and I wish they wouldn’t. I think a lot of it is my living situation which is pretty stagnant. I don’t want to be here. I have no space. Although I will have a little more soon since Margaret is moving out in a week or so. But still. I feel the need to be around stimulating people other creative people. Maybe I’ll just move to another city one of these days. Just got a letter from Mary who is thinking about living in NY for a couple years. I could see doing that but a smaller city would probably be better for me. I can’t believe you’ve been gone so long. Hope the apt. hunting went well. I talked to your dad for a while when I got your address. He is so cool. He was helping me figure out what to do with my life. His words of wisdom were that you don’t have to have it all figured out now and probably won’t. How true. I’m so scattered and fumbling. My trip plans are starting to fade. I’m not sure that this is the right time for me to go overseas. But I know that I will go in the next couple years so I don’t feel like I’m missing an opportunity. Everything is so up in the air but deep down I don’t really mind not knowing what I’ll be doing in six months. I’m sorry about this ribbon. It’s driving me crazy maybe I’ll xerox this and send you the copy. I sometimes copy letters that I’ve written. The ones in which I’ve learned something by writing them. I have a date tomorrow night. This guy I met who if the manager of this band. Name’s Steve something or other. I think he’s a Gemini… SO HOW ARE YOU? I was so sad when Margaret and I were driving – [switch to handwriting] fuck it this is getting ridiculous – home from your house. I hadn’t realized that you were leaving the very next day. I’ve gotten used to saying hello and goodbye to you but there’s always been a definite time that I knew I’d see you again. This time there wasn’t so I was sad. But I know it doesn’t really matter, what are time and distance anyway? But then I can’t help wishing we’d had more time. One thing Tahir always reminds me of is that relationships can never be lost or lessened by time or distance. They can stand still for a long time but they never go backwards. I think he’s right. Man, I wish you were here right now or I was there. I miss you. I might take a trip soon. Go to N.Y., Providence, Boston, Lenox. I’d like to see Jeff. Haven’t heard a word form him since I called him to get his address. Oh well… Tahir is going back to Iowa in a few weeks to start med school at the U of Iowa. Would like to see him too before he goes. Who knows when I’ll even get to Iowa. My restlessness is about to be temporarily assuaged by a weekend trip to the beach with Kevin (Warmath [?]) and Robert (Mair [?]) and a friend of Robert’s. I can’t wait to escape! I want to sleep out in the sand. I’ve done that only once in my life and that was last summer with Kevin. Ooh, know what happened? Jay came to see me in June after you left and stayed the weekend. Well Saturday night around 12:30 Kevin called me up and sand let’s hang out all night and read poetry, which is exactly what he meant. Well, Jay, after just having told me would never be unreasonably jealous and possessive again, was furious. He said he just wanted to go home. Baby. He asked me how I could possibly expect him to believe that someone would call me up in the middle of the night and want to get together but have no intention of trying something. I was so furious. Enough is enough. Anyway, this is my life. I’m listening to the Kinks. Yay. I love you.
– Lis
Give Evan a big, wet, sloppy kiss for me. And tell him our talk wasn’t for nothing even though I broke up.

You wrote this letter shortly after the going-away party that my parents hosted for me and Evan in McLean just before we moved to Boston, which is why you didn’t know when you’d see me again. The three of us had graduated from Brown in May.
I don’t think I ever met Jay for more than a few minutes, but it was clear from this that he didn’t understand or deserve you.
Starting with this letter, we wrote each other more than 80 times over the next three years, which is something like a letter every two weeks.


 
July 25, 1987 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
       You’re lucky – I have no typewriter. To the best of my recollection, it’s hidden away somewhere in that vast structure known as Brown High Security. Maybe I’ll be able to get it in the fall.
	Can’t say that I’m sorry to hear about the end of things with Jay. He did seem like a nice guy, though. Never trust an artist, I say. Anyway… About the jealousy thing, I have this to say: If a male person called up my girlfriend (this is obviously hypothetical) in the middle of the night to go read poetry or whatever, I would have similar doubts about his intentions. I mean, he may not have lust in his heart, but he also isn’t going to be calling up male friends for the same purpose. While I doubt that you are naïve in this area, you are perhaps putting things a little simplistically. But, of course, the problem wasn’t that Jay didn’t trust Kevin, but that he didn’t trust you. Or something like that. Anyway, I’m glad that you are finally happy about things.
	I think a company is about to offer me a job. They seem a little strange, but if I can figure out exactly what it is they’re up to, I’ll probably accept. At this point, I’m so bored and sick of spending money I don’t really have that I’m willing to take just about any offer. I have this sort of gnawing worry that I’m doing something so vastly illegal and unethical that when they find me they’ll just haul me away have a good laugh talking about me for the rest of the week. I owe my dad $3000. Feels like monopoly money. The apartment’s nice, but expensive. I love capitalism. I wonder what people without rich fathers and Ivy League diplomas do to survive…
	Whitney broke up with Evan. It’s true. He was a mess. We haven’t met very many people yet. Hang out sometimes with Alex. To be honest, though, I’m not really worried about meeting people. I want to devote my energy to learning how to get along with myself and doing well at work. It’s too complicated caring about things that have free will. I’ve found that there isn’t much satisfaction, no matter how earnestly one loves or is loved back. I think maybe the answer is not to try so hard.
	Have you heard from Karen? I’ve been reluctant to get in touch with her because I’m sure she is deep in some new world. Jeff says she is working 12 hours a day or something.
	Evan and I talked a little bit about what you said about never being able to go backwards (“relationships can never be lost or lessened by time or distance. they can stand still… but they never go backwards.”) It produced in me an interesting reaction. While I agree with you, it also seems like you are missing the point. Is there anything that influences relationships more than time and distance. There is some core thing that never changes, but time and distance are the only way to get a good look at what that thing is.
	Move to Boston. You can stay with us until you get settled. We have lots of room.
	I miss you. How was your date with Steve? Have you heard from Peter? He told me that he intends to “blow me off” (and do the same to Missy). Where is Margaret moving to? Don’t feel guilty if you don’t go overseas. You have nothing to prove.
	Write back.
love,
Brian

I don’t like the tone of this letter. It seems like I missed the point of what you wrote entirely – that our friendship would not be diminished by my move to Boston. I think I was often unnecessarily argumentative back then, and I wasn’t yet in the groove of writing to you.






 
July 29, 1987 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
       I just copied a classic quotation from your letter into my notes. The one about free will. You are funny. I didn’t see how I was missing the point, which means maybe I’m still missing it or maybe I haven’t explained myself well enough for you to know that I’m not. I’m talking of course about relationships and the directions in which they can go. I realize that time and distance are important factors for one to be able to get a good look. But sometimes you just don’t need a good look because it is all so clear and could be nothing but clear. That is what I am talking about. I spent the weekend with Kevin and Robert at the beach and Kevin and I talked about that. He disagrees about regression. He thinks that it does happen and says it has happened to him. I think I know what he is talking about but it seems to me that that could only happen when there was little or no essential core. Or when there was something false about the foundation of the friendship like convenience or lack of understanding. It is difficult to explain this because it is buried in my heart. It is one of the few things that I am completely sure about in life. In my life it is true. And nothing else matters and that is why I don’t have a job or anything else that it is socially unacceptable not to have. I think I started to get out of my body the other night. I have been thinking about it lately and have been aware of what is going on in and around me and it seems ridiculous to say that the human mind doesn’t have the power to do such a thing. So I am convinced that it is entirely possible and that it happens all the time without our awareness. So anyway there I was in bed, sort of meditating and being aware and I felt my head and shoulders start to lift up and then they snapped back down again. This happened twice. You think I’m crazy don’t you and you’re sitting there laughing going PFFFFFFFFFTT. And rolling your eyes. I’m only telling you this because it popped into my head and I am in a state of rambling. I am getting sick or so my body would have me believe. Funny that it should happen now because just last night I started writing about a woman who is plagued by mystery and a failing relationship. At least I’m rid of one of those things. My weekend at the beach was very interesting if not very fun. I enjoyed it more for what it made me think about than for the experience itself. This was because of the company we were in and the chemistry that resulted. We stayed in Philly one night at Robert’s friend Esther’s house then went to her other house on the Jersey shore where her parents already were. She also brought two friends with her both of whom I’m sure thought I was odd as I believe Esther did as well. I could tell right away that we were not alike and while there was not always tension there was a lack of sympathy. They of course were all air and fire signs… I was the only earth and Kevin the only water. But I realized the first part of what I just told you before the last so the cause and effect of astrological prejudgments did not interfere. Anyway they were sort of rich and boring and set in their ways. One girl went to UVA the other to Stanford. The thing that bothered me the most was that I couldn’t see how they were all friends and there wasn’t much evidence of them caring about each other. Usually I can tell how people connect but this baffled me. I’m sure that they had some connection that I couldn’t see but it seemed odd and foreign to me. They seemed to coexist period. So since I couldn’t relate to them I didn’t want to pretend that I could so I didn’t. That I’m sure made them think that I was even odder. Is that a word? More odd perhaps. Robert was his usual odd self which I found very refreshing since I don’t think he does it for effect. I don’t think he thinks about the way he acts because he probably can’t act any differently. He is working in Philly now with ex-cons doing construction work. Someone asked him what program he was in and he said cognitive science but they meant de-tox and such. He’s off to Europe in a week or two. Thanks for your words of wisdom about going overseas. You’re right. But one place I do have to go is anywhere but here. I can’t live at home for very long or I will die. I’m already having trouble breathing and I know it’s because I feel stifled here. So it’s time to be frugal and get some income so that I can get out. Margaret moved to a townhouse in Bethesda or is actually moving this weekend after she gets back from N.C. where she’s been vacationing. That means I’ve had her car for the last few days which is heavenly. After she moves it’ll be a bleak reality… Anyway to answer your other questions I haven’t heard from Peter. I tried calling him a couple times then it occurred to me that perhaps he was in Europe with his family. Oh the other question was Steve and our date. Well it was fine as dates go… But I hate dates… Listen it’s not too complicated. You just have to take going through hell as a matter of course. And expect that you’ll come out of it. That’s what I do. I’m sorry about Evan and Whitney. I felt a little guilty when I heard because I had just done that to someone who I’m sure thought that it was in no way deserved. I’ll see you sometime this summer/fall I’m sure. Hell maybe I will move to Boston. It’s nice to know I’m welcome anyway. Take care of yourself and eat well. I hate trying to have a talk by letter. Maybe it’s more of a love/hate. That’s enough drivel.
Love,
Lisa

You weren’t missing the point. I was.
Notable line: “You just have to take going through hell as a matter of course.” I wish it wasn’t like that for us, but it was.


 
September 6, 1987 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
It seems I am always listening to Joan when I start writing you a letter. What does this mean? How are you doing you nine-to-five full-time rat-in-the-race? I am still rather contentedly semi-unemployed but I really do need money. I know that I will look back on this time as a time to be envied because my life is relatively free of distractions so I am able to think and be productive. But I think I need a change nonetheless. So I have set myself a deadline, and if I have no prospects (for jobs not husbands) within two weeks I am going to sell used cars. Maybe not but I’m going to get a job. That’s the point I’m trying to make. It’s time for me to get off my oh-so-padded ass. Otherwise life is interesting as always and it keeps my brain ticking away furiously. I think I am about to enter another state of mental restlessness but I am trying to figure out ways to curb that energy into something useful and manageable. I went to my brother’s house on Friday night where they were having a party for his birthday. It was a wild and fun redneck night of quarters and hog tie (Mexican) in which I was reminded of my distant past, in other words, freshman year. Last week a bunch of us went to the county fair and sat on top of Eric’s step van and watched the tractor pulls. Then we ran to see the pig races but missed them by a minute. Saw the duck races instead. Ate an extremely phallic corn dog. Jay called a couple days later and asked what my social life was like, what I did at night and I said oh, we went to the county fair, and he said well now I don’t feel so bad about my life. In addition to the party and the fair there was the matter of the cookout, which you could have come to had you been in this state, or the next. It was actually a very nice cookout and there was nothing but earth and water. And some ground beef and baked beans. I saw your mother last week and she asked if I had heard how you were getting along. Went to Wheaton to pick up my sunglasses which I had left in your car. I always like seeing your parents because they are nice people and I like them. But no one can ever take the place of my Honey of Cohasset, Mass. Sorry but I knew I’d get a grimace out of you with that. I will most likely see you in a month or so, or whenever homecoming weekend is. Mary is planning to come out to Brown that weekend too so we’re going to have a reunion. If you don’t come to Brown I will come out to Boston and see you. I expect that you are thrilled. Sorry about my wryness. It is just a quirkiness mood. I am reading the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas by Gertrude Stein. Figure that one out. It is great. All about the art world in Paris in the early 1900’s when Picasso and Cezanne and Matisse and lots of other gems were schlepping around making good art. I am simultaneously reading the autobiography of Colette which is great in an entirely different way. Both make me want to write. Have you been writing and if not why? No reprimanding tone intended. I got a call from Mats Nilsson a few days ago. It was two o’clock p.m. for him and eight o’clock a.m. for me but I was happy nonetheless to hear from him. He is living in Stockholm the city of my dreams now. I met him through my cousin last summer and we just recently got engaged I mean started corresponding. He wants to see me. He might come to the U.S. in January. I might go to Stockholm at some indefinite date. I am all over the place. But what else is new. I am waiting to hear from the National Gallery about a job in the personnel office for which I applied. I would like to work there. It would have nothing to do with art but I don’t care. I hate interviews. Maybe more than you do but maybe not. I spoke with Kira a few days ago the same day I spoke with Mats. She is at Brown and didn’t sound too happy to be there. She had the pre-school jitters about seeing people and meeting new people etc. I gave her a pep-talk and wrote her a pep-letter. If I were in her position I would be psyched to be there. I told her to take advantage of being surrounded by the people there because they are a scarce breed. I am beginning to think that I belong in an academic environment. I also think it would be wise for me to start thinking about getting a masters. Maybe in a year, I don’t know. Karen is probably going to be in academia for at least another year now because her feet her ankles I mean are not healing very well and she can’t take a full course load. I’m not sure how things are working out with her dad and Brown, etc but that’s a possibility anyway. Which Kira of course is very happy about. I spoke with Tahir, not the same day I spoke with Kira and Mats but the day before. He is slaving away at Iowa med and he sounds pretty happy. I will see him probably over Christmas since going any other time would be silly. Think of it, I’m going to Iowa. Then I will go to the astrologer in Chicago unless I have already found someone good around here. I think my mother worries that this is becoming an obsession with me. Or else she disapproves because it is a pagan belief. I guess that makes me a pagan. Enough. Love.
Love,
Lis

I like your “wry” mood here. It was nice when we could be a little playful. We were starting to adapt to post-college life.


 
October 7, 1987 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
	I am a receptionist. Contrary to what you may assume, there is no joy in that statement. At least I know exactly where I don’t want to be. Worked today at Macintyre Construction co., did lots of dumb but necessary crap, utilized about .07 of my brain cells and made six out of the 10 and a half dollars that the temp company charges their company for my services… Why couldn’t art be one of the high-demand jobs? I’ve decided, though, that it might be good for me to do a dumb-ass job and save my energy for my own work. I don’t know yet whether it will work. Anyway, I’m at Margaret’s for the next couple days since this place is right up the street in Bethesda. I feel sort of displaced. Used to having a great deal of privacy and time to myself. I’m realizing how particular I am about the way I spend my time. I value my solitude and freedom above most other things. That’s one reason I couldn’t live w/ Angela. No chance for solitude. Karen is/was the perfect friend to live with. We are both very active and thoughtful people and we respect each other’s endeavors [?]. I know what I’m trying to say but it’s getting stuck. Is Mercury in retrograde? (Merc. rules communication.) Decided that communication and self-expression are the great ends in my life right now. Constant struggle to express the seemingly inexpressible. Is that a word? Listen, I’m glad I saw you and Evan again. You are two very cool people in very different ways. Remember what I said about pain and my refusal to deal? Well, I tried dealing the other night, letting myself feel it, and my heart hurt physically as a result and there was something torn and raw about it. So there I was feeling torn apart and thinking why do I want to let this happen? What is the reason not to protect myself? By the next morning I had rationalized my way out of the whole thing, knowing all the while it was wrong to avoid feeling things. It is a problem. I don’t suppose that you can empathize, being the king of anti-rationalization… Oh, Bri Bri.
	Well, on with another topic of my life. I’ve started drawing again. Going to Brown helped me to clear my brain, as trips usually do. All of a sudden I felt like I had everything in perspective, after a summer of floundering. While I was away I was afraid it was just an illusion that would vanish once I got home again, but it didn’t. So I’ve decided that I’m going to stop worrying about a career and just get a job that will pay the rent. Then with whatever time and energy I have left I’ll do art or write. So much to learn… (I am sitting on Margaret’s porch freezing, waiting for someone with a key to get home. Finished day #2 as receptionist and I’m loving it.) M. was supposed to wake me up at 7:00 this morning so that I could be at work at 8:30. I woke up at 8:19 and said FUCK and was at work by 8:38.
10/11 Oh Bri, Bri, what is this life we are living. I swear that Venus must be in Scorpio because this is a time of letting go for me. All of a sudden it’s starting to come out, long time coming… Do you know what I mean? I’m having trouble expressing what I mean lately, so I apologize for anything that seems obscure or ridiculous. I am ridiculous. Sometimes I just make myself laugh, I am so funny. I miss seeing you more than once every now and then. But at lwasy what the hell am I typing, at least there is now and then. I’m drinking too much coffee, will probably get breast cancer if I don’t quit it. My best hours for being creative are late at night, though, so coffee helps. God, drug addict… I’m struggling with writing, realizing how similar the process is to art. Difficult. Mary says she has 27 good pages of her novel, and it’s going well. Why do I keep feeling like I’ve already talked to you about all this? I did two self-portraits in the last few days. The first was a contour drawing, which means you look only at what you are drawing, not at your paper, so you have no or little idea what the drawing will look like until it’s done. The second one I just did spur of the moment, sort of hastily and energetically. In the first drawing I came out looking big-eyed and sad and vulnerable, and in the second I came out looking fierce and mean and black. Art fascinates me. It’s such a physical thing and yet there is such a direct connection to the soul. How is that? Jay called. He is going to send me my apple drawing. Margaret answered the phone when he called and she told me it was him and I was gripped with apprehension. I was ready for a verbal assault and the c word again, but he was very nice and said he’d get it in the mail as soon as possible. Yay. So. OK, I have to say it, despite all this turmoil, life is pretty excellent. Probably because of all the turmoil. I really don’t like things to be middle of the road. Must be the Scorpio in me. Sorry, SORRY. Oh, me. Well look, come down here and see me. And bring me a word processor while you’re at it. I could use one. I was using the word processor at work the other day and I thought of you and Evan. You all would have laughed at me for being such a ninny. But I managed ok, it just takes me a little time… Have you gotten plants yet? I’ll see you. Love you.
       – Lisa
It’s time for another office supply store field day – I’m out of everything including typewriter cartridges. That’s why this ancient Royal machine. I love office supplies.

This is the third letter in a row from you. I'm not sure why I wasn’t writing back yet, but we had apparently seen each other in person at Brown homecoming.
One thing I notice about this letter is that we are starting to talk about the process of communication itself – how important it is, and how difficult it can be.
I'm not sure what pain you were dealing with here, and why you thought I wouldn't empathize. I'm glad you didn't let that stop you from telling me about it, though.




 
November 16, 1987 – From Lisa
Dear Brian, 
       Write to me, scumbag. How are you. That was a question. I promise no more abuse in this letter. I’m just joshin. Kira was here this weekend. We talked about astrology. Her Mars in in Virgo and she is a Scorpio, which means she should be searching for o.k. I’ll just stop RIGHT THERE. I really couldn’t see the two of you together anyway, and I’m just babbling in my own small way. Pay no mind. Now on to the big things. I am poor and panicked. I know you’ve heard the first part of that sentence but I bet that second adjective threw you for a loop. I walked around DC today feeling mad and persecuted and I was sure that every single person on the metro besides me had a job. I applied for yet another job today, this time in the beloved realm of retail. But at least the people I’d be sucking up to and fawning over would be other artists. And maybe it wouldn’t really be sucking. Or fawning. Maybe it would just be helping and assisting. And smiling at and trying to pick up. Yes, there are several colorful dimensions to my dire straits. And then Mars is going into Scorpio soon which means I’ll be horny as a house cat in heat. And no tomcat in sight. Forgive the drivel. This typewriter is so fucking loud. My head hurts. I miss you. I sent a letter to the museum school in Barton. I may apply to grad school there. I sent about twenty letters. A few schools, in NY, a few in California, and some other east coast places. One in Chicago. Which I just might get to see over New Year’s if I get a job and get some money to go out there. My latest plan is grad school, next year if I’m lucky. Real world sucks. It makes me want to scream. Not in a good way either. How come you get to be able to deal with it? Why am I the social reject? I guess it’s a matter of tolerance. Tell you one thing I think my mom and dad are running out. Of tolerance for my boobing around. I got dinged by RIF. Happily so. I couldn’t stand working in an office drafting other people’s stupid letters. So I put on my monkey suit all for nothing. Twice, no less. I think it was the second interview that clued me in to the reality of my place in life, which is not in an office. I talked with the president, who told me she couldn’t see why or how my previous experience related in the least to this job. Great. Fuck em all. Then all week I couldn’t even do any art because I got sick and had to sleep all the time. After two days in the house I had to get out so I went to Dakota’s with Margaret and a couple friends. It was Thursday night and all the yuppies were in rare form in their suits and ties. Then this 35 year old guy from Ethiopia dragged me onto the dance floor then talked to me the rest of the night about how I wouldn’t give him my phone number because he was black and if he were white I’d give it to him in a second. Puh. For all his troubles, nothing except maybe my cold. Anyway, I’m out. I’ll save the rest of my bitching and moaning for when I see you. I know you’ll be counting on it. I think I may scream and jump on you when I see you. Love,
       Lis

Matching me with Kira was a nice idea. I always thought she was a kind, attractive person, but I never had feelings for her beyond that. I didn’t know her very well, so maybe if we had spent more time together? To this day, I really don’t know why any two given people have a connection, or don’t. It’s a mystery.
 
December 15, 1987 – From Lisa
Dear Brian, 
       I’m supposed to be sending Christmas letters but I just can’t bring myself to write on those formal little cards that have angels and such on them, so I’m writing you a Plain Letter instead. I know, it’s been a while. All of a sudden my correspondence record took a dive, probably reflective of the general haze of my life. Real world new job such weirdness. Does that say it all? Actually, I’m getting into this whole thing now because I’m starting to be able to relax and get a perspective on things and people. There are a couple people at work who I feel I have potential to develop cool relationships with. So I’m psyched about that. It’s been a while since I’ve felt like I was around people who were like me and understood my motivations. Probably since around oh, say, May 26th or so… That’s the thing I can’t get used to, the separation. Guess that’s why I’ve felt sort of cut adrift lately. But like I said, things are getting cooler and cooler and soon I will be in a sea of coolness. Drinking the large bottle of Johnnie Walker Red that I just got from Utrecht for Christmas… We should indulge in a little tequila and tobacco the next time we’re together. Which will be…? Are you going to be home at all any time soon? Hoping against hope. I miss you. Margaret and her housemate Eugenia and I are talking about flying up to Boston some weekend in the next couple week I mean months. We all have dear friends we’d like to see. Oh and I guess maybe I could see you and Evan too. Ha. I crack myself up sometimes with my humorousness. I can’t stand it. I came across that picture that Pete took of you, me and Mary in your living room losing it over god knows what. It makes me laugh. As do you. I went to a party last night. D.C. is fucked. It was the most yuppiefied party you could imagine, stuffed shirts and seemingly ditzy women in frou-frou evening dresses. And me meanwhile in my funky stretch pants and combat boots. And the dog’s name was Buffy. But there were a few interesting people there, people who work at the Post with Angela. One of whom I have a date to go ice skating with sometime soon. I hate dating. But I’ll try to live with it. What else. I’m just happy to be home in my own room for a change. I’ve been running around a lot lately, spending the night out at Margaret’s usually. It gets to be draining after a while. I haven’t been doing art for many reasons, but I think the lull is coming to an end. I’m feeling inspired, as I did to write this letter, and I have some ideas and plans for drawings and prints and such. I’m getting this forty hour a week job thing down too, so I think I’ll be able to manage my time a little better. I’m considering taking painting or printmaking at the Corcoran, just for some structure and pressure to work. And equipment. I’ll see if I have the time and money. Probably good for applying to grad schools too. Anyway, I’m leaving for Chicago soon. I hope that if you are coming home sometime it is not next week. I still have to make this fucking dress… So, happiness. I am loving you as we speak. 
Love,
Lis



The photograph that you mention here is from a trip that we took to Great Falls, VA during the Xmas break the year before. You, Peter, and I all had cameras. Unfortunately, I no longer have the negatives to the ones I took, so the scans below are from the prints that were made at the time. I don’t remember the photos that you and Peter took. I’d love to see them if you still have any.

Dear Lisa,
	Lisa, Lisa, Lisa. I am working on a poem called “I would like to”. It starts: “sleep for a week.” That’s all I’ve got so far, though I may add more later. I am at work, and it is boring being here.
	I am dedicating the rest of my life to perfecting the way I write the letter “g”.
	Oh, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa. What do you do when you’re at work and you get actual human feelings instead of the more appropriate work feelings? I am so unprofessional, I don’t know what would happen if I had a boss who actually paid attention to how I spend time. Fortunately, no one cares.
	Life is shit. I’ve seen Sue twice recently. She lives about 5 minutes from me. I have decided to go see a shrink because I just can’t put up with this mess any more. Also, I have decided to admit to anyone who is interested that I have no clue about life whatsoever. There are all these things I believe in that I have been shown cannot be true. I can’t stop believing them, or don’t want to. Sorry about all the fractured grammar. Passion is the key to life, I think.
	If the above paragraph makes any sense to you at all, you may award yourself with 1 (one) gold star.
	I miss you. When are you going to have enough money to move up to Boston? How was Mary in Chicago and all that? I find myself wondering when people were born a lot. Not that I know anything about individual signs, but I will see strange similarities between disparate people sometimes, and I wonder if they have the same sun sign. It’s all for me, isn’t it? Also, sorry about what happened there at the end of the last time we saw each other. I can’t figure out exactly how important that kind of stuff is – to myself and to other people. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, don’t worry about it.
	This letter sucks and I am ending it. I will send it only because I owe you about 20 pages of correspondence. Come visit us.
love,
Brian

I finally wrote you a letter, at least. I don’t recall what happened when we saw each other, or why I felt the need to apologize for it.
 
February 14, 1988 – From Lisa
Dear Brian, 
       I think about your g’s pretty regularly, probably because I write a lot and I notice that my g’s are becoming more like yours. They don’t curve at the end but they are straight and getting longer and longer. I like them. Some of them curve. So life is not all bad. But you are right, in many ways life can be and is shit. But only from certain angles. There are always other shitfree angles from which to live life. I have gotten into some major funks lately in which I have felt completely weighted down by sadness for no apparent reason. Sometimes loneliness, the feeling of lack of communion, lack of intensity. It amazes me how I change, or how my perspective changes, one extreme to another. I never expect to be living the same life from one day to the next. Which I think is a good thing because it means temporary escape from certain things, but also temporary loss of other things. So it is a trade off, but I am never bored and there is always that question to be answered. I am very sorry that you are gooig I mean going through Suehell. That sucks big time and when I think of it it makes me feel the feeling of a big black hole in my chest. But I think that is when you have the potential to do the greatest things. I have thought and written and put onto paper some really cool things as a result of feelings like that. Yes, passion is the answer to life, so don’t be a lump. And as for those non-work human feelings, it is so fine, it is more than fine, that’s what this is all about. Fuck everything that doesn’t let you do what you feel. Someone at work (Aldo) was saying how behind he was in everything and I said how can you be behind, what you are is what you are, meaning why set up lines and straight edges and comparisons that in the end are a waste of energy? I am trying to get rid of should. There is no should. I am doing what I want to do, what I am inspired to do and that is that. Karen and I talked about forward motion and how I felt that by doing a lot of things at once I was moving laterally and not forward but she said once you are facing in that so called lateral direction you are inevitably pointing forward. Wisdom. Karen has moved to Lenox and is now commuting to Brown once a week to take her last course. Kira wrote me about this and sounds like she is dealing pretty well, accepting it. I was not surprised at the news. I think that Karen will be happier and will recover better this way. But I am not sure that I am ready to think of her getting married anytime soon. No cause for alarm, there are no definite plans in the works. It’s just something I think about once in a while. Can’t imagine being that ready to commit myself. Just called Jay today to wish him a happy birthday. I think he still feels hurt about our break up but he wants to keep in touch. Strange, it seems so distant to me. It’s like what we talked about about how you perceive yourself having changed into a different permutation of yourself. I am ready I think to be in another relationship. Talking to Tahir the other night about being attracted to this guy at work but realizing he and I would not be very good for each other, Tahir said it would be hard for me to break that habit of being attracted to types of people who are not right for me. I know that I am like that. I can’t seem to want what is good for me. not enough challenge or excitement. Dumb, but I am still oh so young and have so much to learn. And I always seem to keep my sense of humor about these things, which is a good thing to have, a buffer of sorts. There are those painful moments though, when I lose it, but those are as necessary as the buffer. It seems such a delicate balance. The people who are born with the least natural defense against pain try to build up the thickest walls but fail mostly to be able not to feel, and those with the natural defenses are almost without a choice protected from feeling. Why all these walls to begin with, why are people hurt, why do people hurt? Look at your left palm and see whether the top major line is straight or curved upward toward your first or second finger. I’ll bet yours is wicked curved and I’ll bet Evan is pretty straight. Tell me if I’m wrong. Just a theory. Aldo wrote a poem and dedicated it to me and there is one line which I particularly like: As if lounging -- . I write poems now and then and it always amazes me to unfold these pieces of writing later and see what I have written. Things that come out of this part of my mind that opens only long enough to get something out, only when there is enough pressure forcing it to open. That is where the passion. Letting yourself be forced open, letting go the resistance. Don’t resist yourself, what is the point? I am listening to R.E.M. I want to write music, I want to be in a band. I am serious. I love having a guitar and getting callouses and knowing that one of these days I will be good. I had a dream the other night that I was playing and it sounded amazing. I wait for the day and I know that it will come. That is amazing. So much to do. Lately also this urge to get back into photography, have a darkroom. I am drifting away from painting but only because I am drifting, that is really too weak a word, toward other forms of expression. So I do not resist. Not that I am letting myself sway in the wind, reedlike, but I am not looking over my own shoulder with cemented ideas of what is right what I should do. So in that respect I am happy. Some of the frustration has left me and I end up with more energy. Yay. Ah, lightness. So. I don’t know when I will feel like it is the right time to move. I cannot predict myself, one day I have a life plan the next I forget what it was I wanted to do. Duh. But in general I know what it is that matters, so nothing else does. Matter. Enough philosophizing and rambling. I too miss you. I like the fact that you know me. I am not feeling very known these days which is hard for me. I hope that it will be soon that I see you. It makes me laugh that you write on graph paper.
Love,
Lis

The idea of Karen marrying Tim was hard for us to accept, since we still felt young and unfinished.


 
February 27, 1988 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
       I write you a letter. It is so cool – I am visiting Peter in Ohio. It is college here. You remember college. They do it better than we did. So many drugs, and so many drugged people. Sort of scary, sort of impressive. They never actually have to communicate with each other, and they are here now wandering around in Peter’s room (which is the place to be), and I have undoubtedly insulted them as they discretely read over my shoulder. Such is. Hog heaven of sorts.
       When I got your last letter, I was so into it. I paced around our living room for about an hour after I read it. I had the return letter all composed in my mind. I was moved, you see. But now, remembering nothing of your letter, I cannot respond. All I remember is the feeling that you had once again written to Evan and myself on consecutive days. It was a weird thing.
       Whereas at the beginning there were two or three people here in Peter’s room, there are now at least 532. They are having a party. Weirdness abounds. Joan plays loudly. Lisa, I love music so much. I admit it to you. It’s the one thing. All the girls are into Peter.
       He says hi.
       It is hard to think. I am paranoid about people reading this. I’m getting drunk and have to urinate, too. I was going to say something intelligent, but it seems inappropriate. People are so fucked – that’s what I think. I am so surprised to be human, too, sometimes. If only I was superior instead of just baffled.
       New part:
       OK, I went away for awhile and did stuff. Everyone is gone now and it is dark and I am listening to this new Kate Bush album that I bought today in Canton, OH. It is so good and I am only mad that Sue is the one who told me about it. Listen: the people here are out of their minds. I got blasted out my mind and I’m still the soberest person here. The social situation is overwhelmingly insane, which is always an interesting thing to see in bright, living color. One guy crushed his hand in a door. He had this large, straight blue and red gash across two fingers, the tips of which were purple. He had been dripping blood into a plastic helmet. He was embarrassed, I guess, about getting blood on someone’s helmet. I met him in the bathroom where he was attempting to wash the helmet out in a sink. He was blasted tripping insane. I wanted more than anything to grab him by the wrist and say, "come on, you imbecile, let’s go get your hand fixed." But it would have been a faux pas! He was embarrassed. And his blasted tripping friend was making these pacifying comments, trying to keep the conversation smooth, because he was so petrified of having to actually admit what was happening in reality. Beyond peer pressure. It would have been awkward, socially, for this guy to help his friend, and for me too, I guess, because I walked away.
       Remember that time junior year when peter came to visit me at school and we (he and I) ended up tripping in your room? Peter playing guitar and Roddie what’s-his-name trashed and David pretending to be so. And it was so awkward and juvenile? You remember? Yes? It’s just like that, but everyone on the hall. Too much.
       It’s weird between Peter and me because he thrives in this. As much as I am connected to him, I am astounded at his “way”. Not that mine is demonstrably better or more healthy or more fun, but our lives are so alien to each other. I am so unprepared to experience this conflict.
       I don’t know if it was the pot I smoked or what, but I apologize for the weirdness of this letter, if need be. It is the first time I have opened up on a piece of paper in a long time.
       Miss you. It’s comforting to know there is another real person in the world, even if she is into astrology and palm-reading. I take strength in you.
love,
Brian
Oh Lisa, Visit Us! Do.

I think this was the first really good letter I wrote you. I was sitting at a desktop computer trying to ignore the people filling up the room around me, which is why I was paranoid about them reading over my shoulder. I don’t really remember the party, but I do remember that one guy's hand. It was brutal, and so awkward.
The “weird thing” about you writing to me and Evan at the same time was just that our correspondence seemed so personal to me, and yet you were also writing my roommate in parallel. I wasn’t really jealous – it just felt a bit odd to realize that he and I each had a separate, private relationship with you.


 
March 5, 1988 – From Lisa 
Dearest Brian,
       Never compose in your head without getting it down. Your letter was great. We are real. I came very close to writing this letter immediately upon returning home and reading your letter, before even eating, but then my body won out and I figured I’d have more mental energy if I had more physical support. So I ate and now I respond. I am tired. I had no caffeine today as a result of saying to someone at work that it’d be so easy for me not to drink coffee for a day. So I did it and he congratulated me and I am tired. Parts of me are racing though. For various, reasons. In a small way my body has gone to automatic, due to the fact that my head is a little bit in the clouds, due to some interesting happenings. It is the Cancer, the bartender that I’ve had a crush on for the last few months. I went out with him a couple nights ago. He asked if I was interested in helping him on a photo project so we got together to talk about it and I was amazed at the fact that I was with someone who I could talk to about meaningful things and feel understood. So we talked and we talked and I found I was to be nude. In his photographs. I said I didn’t know how I felt about it we agreed to do something the next night. I troubled myself over deciding and with the help of my father realized that by not doing it I had nothing to lose, by doing it, I might. So I told him no with the knowledge that that might be the last I ever saw of him if he was interested in me only as a model. But he said come over and we’ll have dinner and I said yes and we did. And then I liked him even more, and that night sleeping I woke up many times and was so psyched. It seemed too good to be true. It may still seem so. It may be so. I am in that phase where I have really no clue where I am and I have to be careful not to be too vulnerable. And all that fucking crap that I hate so much. But man is this cool and for fleeting instants I can be flying because it is so cool. I don’t know, I know nothing. I am too preoccupied with this thing to be much good at ptuuing I mean putting together coherent thoughts about anything else. How nauseating, to be reduced to a puddle by all this romantic beginning crap. So I should just stop thinking about it right? Yeah right. I’m worthless for doing anything right now and I think I’ll probably end up sitting on my ass all night. My mother is not home. She has been visiting Oma. It is nice to be here just with my dad. We get along differently when it is the two of us. I like it. I am thinking more of moving out and living downtown. I need a space. Maybe in a couple months. It would be a good thing. I want to live by myself but may not be able to afford it. Angela is keeping an eye out for me though and will let me know if there is something in her building. Dupont Circle. Would be nice. So. I can’t muster any more thought. Sorry. But I had to speak when I heard from you. I will see you.
Love,
Lis

I wasn’t sure what to make of the “romantic beginning” you described here, but I knew you would make good decisions. I’m glad you talked to your father first.
 
April 1988 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	In this issue: More stuff, Further discussions, Etc. Also: explanations of life. OK? I have forgotten everything you last wrote and am too lazy to go get the letter. Something about nude portraits? Heady stuff. Anyway, one hopes all is well with you.
	Life here is like this:
   fig. 1
i.e. pretty much the same all the time. Better than school, though. The hard part is all this stuff about having to, like, try to have fun. I have honestly never tried at anything before. Seems kind of silly, even.
	Oh wait! I actually a) went to a party and b) met a woman. It was easy. We talked about how hard it is to meet people out of school. She was sort of normal and quiet, which I thought was great (in theory at least), but we will probably NEVER meet again. How is this stuff supposed to work, anyway? What do ugly/stupid/annoying people do? This kind of stuff really concerns me. I am so sick of TV. I am so counter-suggestible (look it up). Maybe I should be a nun. But don’t worry – I’m still as incoherent as ever.
	… so. I was going to change the topic, but what the fuck. What are you supposed to do, anyway? Wake up in the morning and just shape your life? Decide? I hate that. At work, this is what is important: Business. Being smart. Well-ironed shirts. On TV: Sex. I am depressed every time I walk out of a movie. I can’t even decide whether these things really are important, I’m so busy retreating from them. Jeez… You once said something about looking good without consciously “taking care of yourself”. That is how it should be. How terrible to decide to be successful at something.
	Jeffy is coming up next weekend. He is successful, but I like him anyway. Do you have Karen’s address? Are you coming up for graduation? Come up for graduation. Campus dance.
	I don’t know, Lis. Sorry to bitch at you for a whole letter. My parents sold our house. It’s a sad thing. Sue and I have been spending some time together, but we are just passionless and gentle, like old people. Life is good, though, and I am learning. Miss you.
love,
Brian

My cavalier attitude about the bartender is kind of funny, but it also bugs me a bit that I didn’t put more effort into responding directly to what you had written me. I think I just trusted that we were reaching each other at a deeper level, and that is actually what makes these letters interesting to read decades later. The details weren’t usually the most important thing.
I think Bill Doonan was invited to the party I mention here and took me along. It was super-uncomfortable because few people knew each other, so I was proud of myself for initiating a conversation with a nice  woman. We established a very modest rapport, and, in a rom-com, would have exchanged numbers and started dating. In reality, there was no way I was going to push things that far, so I never saw her again. I felt very alienated from American society and its mores, and it really shows here.


 
May 14, 1988 – From Lisa
My dear Brian, Brian, I am trying to write to you for so long I am trying and then distraction. I have been you wouldn’t believe how distracted. At the moment I have cramps, physical and emotional and every other kind of -al. A recent line from my journal – I feel fucked. This state of being comes and goes. Now fucked, then fucking spectacular. It takes some learning to deal. The main thing is this relationship I find myself unable to circumvent. With this guy at work with whom I have felt an affinity, not to mention an excellent passion. This is the thing, it is a good thing but we are holding back. I was willing in the beginning (about 3 weeks ago) to take a risk, explore the potential. He got scared after the initial breakthrough, said it was a complication. Then a reversal, after I had spent the night crying and trying to stop, not being able to sleep, not want to feel that way So again I was thrown into emotional optimism, vulnerability, allowing myself to care. I didn’t have to numb myself after all, I thought. So a brief time of soaring, then fear, and starting to pull back. Me saying it is a little complicated, him saying try to be rational. Right, and next I’ll try to give birth to an elephant. So I am torn up at knowing how it is right and not knowing if will have a chance. He is easily hurt. I am easily hurt. We both care. Shit. Then I start to feel like I am wishing, making his life complicated, being a burden. Which makes me pull back even more. Shit. He may come to visit me. I don’t know if he will still be here when I get back. There is no telling. I know nothing. It sucks. But when it is good it is beautiful and life is so fine and joyous. Most of the time there is little joy, fear being the emotion of the day. I feel cut apart. Victimized by inability to rationalize my way out. Consumptive.
	I am so ready to see you.
	I will yes be in Lenox for the summer. I am coming up to Brown for graduation, then I am coming home with you if that is fine. I will cook for you but I will not clean your bathrooms. I start work on June 3. Evan’s birthday. A good day for beginning. … so Brian, I want to know things. I always want to know. I am tired.
	Next day again tired, still wanting to know. Feelings of desperation, things out of perspective, things hurting. Shit, man. No simplicity, no lightness.
	Except at the sound of your and Evan’s voices, man, that was makes me happy. Maybe once I get out of here and settle into something new I’ll feel more stable, more sane. But you are right, there is something good about feeling and breathing, better than stagnation. I have shitloads to do today. Getting shorn, for one. Four more days of work left. Yeehah. Sorry I am sketchy. I’m psyched to see you and really talk. I love you.
       Lis

“This guy at work” is Ron, I presume.


 
June 4, 1988 – From Lisa
You guys.
It made me happy to see you.
Who got to open the letter? ha.
Lenox is small. The grocery store closes at six.
I live in an alcove in the attic on a futon.
I feel fine and my new tapes rule.
I want my guitar.
Karen lives next door and we hang.
I live alone up here but only until next week.
Yes there is some magic here but I won’t be falling in love.
(mark my words)
I see you.
Love.
       – Lis

We had just seen each other at Brown’s commencement, since Karen was officially graduating.
 
 
June 12, 1988 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	Here is what I think. “Verdi Cries” is a great song. They played part of it on All Things Considered the other day. Yes, I’ve started listening to public radio. Typical interview:
Interviewee: I can’t repeat his exact words, but essentially he said, “Screw the environment”.
Interviewer: Why don’t you give us the exact quote and then we’ll decide if we should air it.
Interviewee: He said, “fuck the environment”.
Evan says I am slowly but surely crossing over to the other side.
   The man in 119 takes his tea all alone. Mornings we all rise to wireless Verdi cries. I’m hearing opera through the door. The souls of men and women, impassioned all. Their voices climb and fall; battle trumpets call. I fill the bath and climb inside, singing.
   He will not touch their pastry but every day they bring him more. Gold from the breakfast tray, I steal them all away and then go eat them on the shore.
   I draw a jackal-headed woman in the sand, sing of a lover’s fate sealed by jealous hate then wash my hand in the sea. With just three days more I’d have just about learned the entire score to Aida.
   Holidays must end as you know. All is memory taken home with me: the opera, the stolen tea, the sand drawing, the verging sea, all years ago.
       – Natalie Merchant
“Verging” is my new favorite word.
	Much as I try to avoid it, there is all this stuff. My friend Gina was just released from the hospital and is now back living with Sue who treats her like shit. It makes me mad, but who am I to say. Plus I am just new friends with Gina and don’t even really know why. It would be terrible if I just cared for her out of pity, but I don’t even know here as a real person, just someone in desperate trouble.
	Jeffy wants to call you, but I have once again lost the number there. You love him, don’t you? Admit it.
	It was, oh, wonderful having you here. Fun getting to know Kira, too. She was different than I thought. Pictures came back, some awesome, some shit. Tell Karen I will write her a letter if she writes me one first.
	It’s too easy to just say “I see you”. Nice thought, though…
love, love, love,
Brian

You and Kira came to visit us in Boston.
 
I think my reaction to your “I see you” comment is mainly just another example of me being argumentative, but I was probably also trying to push you to say what you saw.


 
June 14, 1988 – From Lisa
Dearest Brian,
	I can’t for the life of me remember the tune but I remember the words and the odd effect they had on me. A good song, it has some kind of rightness, like a lot of R.E.M. does for me. Something that says this is what matters, this is what it’s about, this is what is screaming out at you in a moment of life. Relevance. It has relevance. I don’t like this thick pen but it is the only one I have that will make carbons. I got your letter today and with great happiness. I will give Karen what for. I haven’t seen her much. Work all day then get home and don’t know if I should take away what little time she has w/ Tim. Yes, I know, that’s bullshit. I am running around a lot, working. Not much extra time but what I have I feel like I am using. There are too many I’s in this letter. This is a good time for me. Some of it is unsettling. Some feelings of strandedness, being out of touch. Can’t use the phone long distance, can’t drive off somewhere, can’t get around. Can’t even use my typewriter right now because I’m not sure if it will bother my new roommate, don’t want to start off badly by pounding away. So I scribble. I just wrote a letter to Ron, the guy from home/work. The other night I talked to Angela and she mentioned him and I got a bad pain in my stomach so I realized I wasn’t recovered. So I thought and felt and decided I might as well write and get some of it expressed. So I did, in a moderate way, and now I feel more resolved. Trying to be more aware of what I am really feeling, trying to dig through all the rational shit and get down to the real heart. This atmosphere encourages such explorations. People here feel bad if they don’t have some kind of breakdown in class… But it’s more being able to think, distance myself, (is that contradictory?) and talk with people about things. One guy in my house is a good listener and we talk and he is not doing most of the talking. That is a good thing. It is so much easier for me to write, though. Maybe that is one of the reasons I find myself pulling away from people, in a physical sense – like why I came up here. Relating to people through writing is such a different dimension to me that it adds to the relationships I have. I suppose I also need the solitude, although a large part of me is simultaneously seeking communion, missing it. Maybe this is to make room for new communions. And then the question, do I love too many people? The obvious answer – no. I only think, how fortunate. It is getting dark. The frogs are bellowing. I want to see those pictures. I went to get mine done and the place, the only place, in Lenox was closed. So I wait. Here is my phone # - just got a phone on the 2nd floor too, which is closer to my room – 413 637 4057. You are funny. I have fun with you. I think this summer is going to fly by. I love you. I love Jeff. ha.
Love,
Lis

This is a very good letter. I can almost see the gears turning in your head as you wrote it. I’m glad there was someone in your house who was a good listener.


 
June 20, 1988 – From Brian
Dear Lisa
• I thought you recorded the new 10,000 Maniacs CD. Yes? That has Verdi Cries on it. Perhaps I am confused as to the meaning of your letter.
• I just came back from VA where I was since Friday. Interesting and strange but good to be back from. Too tired, stoned, dull to detail.
• About Karen: Go easy on her, she just wrote me a letter. (Hard to write stoned – stop paying attention towards the end of words and spell them really strangely: “abouk Kared”.) Hard that she needs to be left alone with Tim. Not sure that wouldn’t make me angry. Tempting to write joint letters to you two like you to Evan and me.
• How is roommate? (Pardon lack of full grammar – again: too stoned).
• About Ron: So many things I feel about this. I don’t really understand how you feel about him. It seems too strong for you to let go yet you want to let it go. Yes? How do you reconcile this?
• I don’t understand why it is easier for you to write than talk. Writing uses so much ink.
• Sorry to give you shit about Jeffy. Sometimes it is good for me to berate you about that. I have trouble reconciling your and your relationship with him in my mind. My problem, I suppose…
• About you: Seeking communion (started to write “confusion”), missing communion, to paraphrase your letter. Me too. Too tired to elaborate. Scary to write this way (your way), hope you can understand it. Wish you were here to hold; could be with you infinitely. Lovelovelove,

       – Brian

“I don’t understand why it is easier for you to write than talk. Writing uses so much ink.” This is cute, but seems dense now, since you explained the value of emotional distance so well in your letter.
Your relationship with Jeff: What I was hinting at here is that it was harder to get to know you when you were going out with him, because his personality tended to dominate. I could see you more clearly after you broke up, and I liked that.
Begin intoxicated allowed me to write with less inhibition here, and you can see my emotions spilling over at the end. I didn’t usually write “your way” because I was afraid that I would say something I shouldn’t.


 
June 27, 1988 – From Lisa
Dear Brian. Got your letter today. Sweetness. I read it while immersed in the bathtup listening to Pink Floyd. Appropriate, I think. Listen to my ravings [?] of the day. Just got home from a barbecue at the stables, the building where the costume shop is, also where some of the people live. Went with a couple people from my house, sat around a while then got up walked down the drive, started running, ran along the road in the dark. Out of breath, running, starting to cry. And so it goes. I guess it’s stress, the fact that I have been working non-stop all day every day not enough sleep. Never getting out of here. I am coming to Boston as soon as I can. I would like to see you. I need to stay sane.
Weirdness here. Weird goings on, realtionships, uncertainties, strangeness. I hate having to be in control all the time. I don’t always feel in control. Right now I feel shaken up, And tired. What do I want? I can’t stand half-knowing. No, I didn’t tape 10,000. I think I will though. I wouldn’t mind having that song right now.
- roommates are fine and good. It is fine. Having roommates
- Ron: he is not what I need. Fuck it. It is not so strong that I can’t let go. I am letting go. There are better things. I need more water. (Astro.)
- Why is it easier for me to write? One thing: most people listen better when they read. Another: I am too good a listener, I make people open up and talk. Too: it feels better, this ink Thing. I am more focused on opening myself, letting things out when I don’t have to be receptive. Some of this applies some of the time. Not all all.
- Jeff. What’s to reconcile? What’s your problem?
- Me, I am floating, barely. I cry a lot. But not enough.
love you.
– Lis

This is nearly poetry.
You are a good listener, but I’m glad you also realized that sometimes you need to be heard, too.


 
July 3, 1988 – From Brian (unsent)
Lisa,
	I don’t know. For me, it is hard to write, especially these days. Honesty reads harshly and subtlety seems affected. I am always tempted to mock myself. So I’m jealous: Your letters ring so many bells so easily. I’ve started this letter over at least ten times in a week.
	Life here is a struggle. I am bothered that work is spilling over into my real life, but I suppose that is the idea. Anyway, I guess it is just work itself that is bothering me, but I am determined to at least finish what I am doing. Some of the people are impossible, and the whole thing is absurd when I think about it, but what the fuck do I know? Gotta do something between now and taking over the world…
	I passed Sue on a sidewalk near her house the other day, and she screamed. It was great. I am so in love with her. It’s gross, I know. Sorry. See, and the bad thing is it’s so great living with Evan e.g., but you never hear me say anything about that. I only appreciate things if they can upset me.
	Tell Karen Hi and letter is coming soon.
	I am missing you too much. I pictured you running down the road after the party (in your letter). Every minute there are things to say that do not go on paper. Tell me when you are coming or when I should go there. This weekend is bad, but soon would be so fine. Noises,
       - Brian

I tried to convey how strongly I felt without actually being specific about any of it. I wasn’t satisfied with this and didn’t send it until months later.
 
July 5, 1988 – From Brian
Lisa, 
       I have started this over and over again. You wouldn't believe. It would be OK if I could just write something I can stand to read the next day. It didn't used to be this way. Your letters ring so many bells so easily, I am jealous. I want to show you that I am the same way, but it is hard. I suppose you know without me having to prove it, but all the same…
       I don't know why it is so hard for me to keep things simple, but it is. I try to keep things in front of me where I can see them, but they are always too many and they go where they like. These days I have no life and still I cannot understand what the fuck is going on. It is depressing.
       Life is art, yes? I hope so.
       Work sucks – I am under pressure to get stuff done, but there is so much politics between me and this one woman I have to work with that we accomplish nothing. She is out of her mind sometimes, and I feel tied to her as she sinks. I wish we could just get done what needs to be done, but it is not turning out to be that simple. Still, I am not giving up.
       We went to the fireworks yesterday and they were wonderful. Me and Evan and Alex. We were strange together. Sometimes it is hard to reach Alex, and I am not always as patient as I should be. I got stoned and for awhile it was as if I was finally like everyone else in the world. Like they had been waiting for me to get it. I think that Peter actually believes that there is a group of people-who-do-understand and a group of people-who-do-not-understand.
       My friend, Regina, is out of the hospital. I don't remember if I told you any of what she has been going through. Her father abused (tortured) her as a child. He was trying to make her tough. Anyway, she is back living with Sue, and it is hell on me to go over there. I walked by Sue on the sidewalk once and she screamed. Actually, that was great, but the rest hasn't been. Sue treats Regina like shit, and it absolutely makes me furious. It is sad the way that she is still inside my head. I can still hear her saying she didn't want to “dissemble” her feelings any longer. It is hard not to be ashamed of some of the things I have allowed to happen to me. I think Regina feels the same way.
       Anyway, I am missing you too much. I pictured you running down the road after the party in your letter. Tell me when you are coming here or when I/we should go there. This weekend is bad, but soon would be so fine. Love.
Brian M. Berns
P.S. Tell Karen hi and letter is coming soon.

I tried again using parts of the unsent version from two days before.
I’m not sure what “life is art” is supposed to mean. Maybe just that I felt creative, even if I wasn’t producing any actual art.
The Regina story was truly bizarre, and made everything with Sue even more painful than usual.
 
July 6, 1988 – From Lisa
Dear Brian, once again your letter moves me. I think know the things about you that you fear elude detection. And I love the fact that we exchange nebulous phrases with such clarity. There are those who need it all spelled out and I am not good at metaphysical spelling. The other night a problem communicating with someone, speaking in abstractions and he just didn’t understand, pressed me for examples. I withdrew. The things of which I spoke would have shattered under scrutiny. I didn’t like being pushed, resented someone trying to hasten the process of being known. I suppose that is one way that I protect myself, by shrouding myself in some fashion trying to control the pace at which I reveal myself. Maybe this to make up for the fact that after I am revealed I leave myself no defense. This having to do with the fact that at a certain point I trust unconditionally. So I preserve the mystery until I feel ready to let it go. Somehow I think that you have things to say about all this… What, man? Yes, I am missing you too.
7-7 Life is art? Someone told me art is practice for life. I am practicing, sometimes I am just living. Right now I’m just fucking tired.
7-10 Still tired but somewhat cleansed. I would like to see you. Maybe I will come out in a week or 2? Or you came here, you have to see the show… Opening night last night which meant opening night party… Shit, I was so ready for a party. Talking to the production manager, he asked what I was doing in the fall and whether I’d be interested in staying year round. He’s trying to get the money to hire another full-time costumer, doesn’t know if he’ll get it but I said I’d keep it in mind. If so I’d be in Boston for part of the year. ! So. This is going to be a long, hot summer…
7-11 Carrying this letter around with me everywhere I go. Try to write during spare moment of the show. Sometimes it works, sometimes no. The atmosphere in the dressing room (men’s) as one of the guys put it, “is warming up.” Getting to know some of the equity actors, as opposed to the training students. Older, most married, pretty together. I’m enjoying myself. Couple of parties, last 2 nights, one wild, one mild. Long stories to tell. Still waiting for Kira to arrive. She got lost, ended up in Toronto or some such place… Duh. So. I’m off to a cookout. I love you. I am good. Still letting myself feel. Breathing.
Love,
Lisa
P.S. Please send me Jeffrey’s new address because I love him so much I need to express it.

Letters like this one made me feel sane at an otherwise difficult time.
I like how you teased me about Jeff.



 
August 2, 1988 – From Brian
Dear Lisa, 
       Oh no, I am not working on what I should be. I am wearing a tie, though, and that should count for something. We have this gentleman visiting my project today, and I am part of the dog-and-pony show. I am supposed to answer whatever questions he has, which would be OK except that in most cases I don’t know or don’t care or am not allowed to just start over and explain things my own way. I seem to have become something of a pawn; I am the Product Engineer. He is a nice guy, though, it’s just a shame how poorly we spend his time here. Fortunately, I am going to see Crosby Stills & Nash at Great Woods tonight.
       I left those two sets of prints somewhere in the grange (with Karen perhaps). Take good care of them, if you find them. Perhaps we could make a postal trade for the 10,000 Maniacs tape.
       I made it home in time for the funeral. Alex was a wreck. It was horrendous. I locked myself out of the apartment. Evan survived The Forum. Nothing gets done.
       It was too good seeing you. It is frightening to be understood so well. No joke. No escape and no need to escape. I apologize (sort of) for the porch incident. Painful it was/is. Confusing.
       Write.
love,
Brian

The porch incident? I have no idea what this refers to. I hope it was nothing too serious.

 


August 4, 1988 – From Brian
Lisa,
       Look, more words! My car died today on the way home from work. Is it true that if I become a photographer my car would not ever die? With any luck, though, I will be broke soon and all my problems will end. I will be caught up.
       I talked with Evan some about the Forum, and he got me entirely frightened. It’s not a scam, I think. They may be onto something very powerful, but I don’t know what. He claims that it is Einstein to everyone else’s Newton, if that means anything to you.
       I miss Karen, who at one point was a good friend of mine. Does she have good friends anymore? I realized, after you asked me whether I was mad at her for not spending more time with me, that it was entirely within my power to try to spend more time with her. But I didn’t and it is my own fault. I never do stuff like that anymore; I find it too confusing to push on things which clearly may not want to be pushed. Nonetheless, she is an amazing person.
       It’s good when I am like this. I can just pick a thing and talk to you about it. Something provides the necessary distance to me to flit. But the distance is illusory or accidental, and when I am most myself there is none of it. Sometimes I miss it.
       Jeffy sent me a short story from the New Yorker. It was good. Some good lines: “Trees are alive”, “She is still trying to overcome her habit of modest expectations”, “I sympathize with my mother am not on her team”, “they think of themselves as independent spirits on a spring mission. They have agreed to impersonate teachers until they … save up enough money to set themselves free”. Many others, too, which require context. That last one humbles me; it is how I described myself to you, over breakfast/lunch in Lee.
       But now there are suddenly no more right words. I was going through some old letters that I had written to Sue, and I found that there is nothing good to be said for honesty without elegance/structure. That is one thing I have learned. I wish I didn’t love you quite this much. Another runaway train, I suspect.
       – Brian


 
August 13, 1988 – From Lisa
Dear Brian, More extremities. I got your letter, read it as I walked from the Mount [?] up to the stables, cried. It is a great and strange thing, our relationship. Why is it strange, is it better that way, the tension, the pushing and pulling? Would it be more stagnant otherwise? In my eyes, no. I don’t want there to be pain. That is why I cried.
	I am wired. No sleep, trying to stay wired psychologically so that I can stay awake and work. Shit to do, it never ends. I’m looking forward to the end of this show. Three weeks of craziness left. Craziness. Moments of greatness, like driving down the road in early morning fog listening to CCR in a pickup. Warm embraces, people that I really like, good people. I will be sad to leave but in many ways this is killing me. Couldn’t live much longer like this.
	Stress from work, stress from Govane [?]. Not directed at me but she is very tense and I don’t think very happy. I feel it, it gets me. It makes me tense. It is a relief when I am alone in the shop.
	I have no bed. I got home this morning and found bare wood floor where my futon used to be. Karen is going to D.C. I didn’t say goodbye. I hardly saw her the last 3 weeks (since you visited and Tim got back). I missed her. I still do. She did not seem happy the last few days I saw her.
	Why can’t women walk around with no shirts on? It’s not fair. Every day here is a sweaty hell. Naomi and Margaret and I went skinny dipping one night after the show w/ a few other people. Great fun. I may go to the quarry one of these days with some of Gige’s boys.
	8-27 FUCK, I hate not being able to write a complete letter at once. Soon, though, I just may have a normal life and have time. I’m going back to D.C. after this, for a while at least. Thinking about taking off to Paris or somewhere besides U.S.A. to study apparel design. Time to get off my ass and grab a piece of whatever it is I want. Want to talk, I hope to come through Boston on my way home and see you. Will talk to you, let you know. Probably leaving here around the 8th - 10th. I love you.
       – Lis
9-2 Was going to send you pictures but I’ll bring them to you. Now I’m staying til Sat. probably is that the 11th? Will talk to you, see you soon.

I’m not sure what was strange or painful in our relationship at this point. Maybe this refers to the “porch incident” that occurred during my visit?

Saturday
Dear Lisa,
	H.B. ––––––
	Worked all day. I think I’ve finally exhausted myself entirely. I tell my boss how tired I am and he laughs and changes the topic. The other person on my project told me she was coming in today, but she didn’t and I hated her (briefly – she isn’t worth prolonged hate). Office was empty and freezing but I walked around barefoot because it was a luxury not to have all those middle-age suits there too. Found myself staring into brake lights of cars in front of me on the way home, like an animal or something. I was totally absent, not just from the car. I don’t know where I was.
	Hmmm… Evan is taking me to see the Red Sox tomorrow. Excellent choice. That’s the good thing about Boston; everyone loves the Red Sox. They play every day. Like blood.
	I would tell you more about work, but [it] is, unfortunately, only work. They all act as though it were somehow different from normal life. I do spend all my time there, so it is all I know these days. There is one guy who came a few months ago who is pretty cool. He’s made a difference, which is rare. But he’s not like “us”. I haven’t met many who are. Wrong line of work, I suppose. Hard to keep my priorities straight. They gave me a raise, though.
	Miss you. It was as though you weren’t here. Oh well ––––––
	Brian




 
September 30, 1988 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
       Thanks for the advice, though I have no idea what you are talking about. The tone of your letter baffles me but that is perhaps your intent. I apologize if my life is not up to your standards, but I have no desire to fight. My life may appear “dull” but I am unrepentantly happy. And “hellish”? Not since graduation, thank you. Only exhausted, recently, from working too hard.
       You live well, you write well. I would not try to deny. But if our lives close enough that you can into mine, I am saddened that you feel superior. Please do not judge me by lack of “exuberance”; I love life as much as you. I am in awe of the range of detail it encompasses, but fortunately, I am under no pressure to prove it to you.
       I enjoyed Cohasset, like I enjoy good movies. Sharp but safe. Pfft yourself.
       I will perhaps be down for Thanksgiving.
– Brian

This is in response to a letter from you that I no longer have, because I sent it back to you in a huff. It felt a bit too close to pity, which I very much didn’t want, even though I knew you were probably right. I went into high dudgeon instead (again, my tendency to be argumentative). My overreaction seems silly now – I didn’t really mean it, and it faded before long.

BRIAN BERNS!!!
Listen, scumbag, don’t spat with me. Shit man. Seemed. I told you how it seemed.
	a. Why would I write to you and tell you and tell you what I was thinking for the sake of baffling you? Seven out of my 10 planets are in communication signs. The last thing I want is to baffle.
	b. What standards? I am not making comparisons. I don’t have the letter write me, to which I was responding, with me, so I can’t remember exactly what gave me the impression that caused me to think and write what I did. I remember you were exhausted. Maybe I interpreted that as exhaustion in realms other than physical, since that is how I look at life.
	c. Superior, what the fuck?
	d. I love you.
 ha. got you there. nyah.
e. I keep copies of all my letters, no need to send them back to me.
       So. Sorry I upset you, didn’t mean to. I’m certainly not judging you.
       Here is life now: back at Shake & Co. designing costumes for the h.s. production that Karen is a.d.’ing, with about 1/3 the time I’d like to have to do it. It’s mad and crazy. My stress level has skyrocketed beyond anything I’ve ever experienced, though at this moment I am fairly calm. I do nothing but work, from 8 am to midnight. It is amazing that I am even writing this letter, but yours demanded immediate response. I read it in the car stuck in a traffic jam and started writing as I drove but that proved unhealthy. So now I eat and write instead.
	I enjoyed Cohasset too, it’s just that there were so many weird dynamics. I spent the afternoon with Jeff on my way up – had to change trains there, had a few hours to sit and talk, which was way cool. I think he misses you. I won’t get to see you on my way home since my train leaves from Hudson [?]. Thanksgiving would be cool. I will have just been laid off at the Folger and will be collecting unemployment. Maybe. I’m looking forward to being a mere stitcher for awhile – low stress. But this work is the balls, despite the stress. There are still moments when I think shit, I love doing this.  Mostly the actual design and creating work. Fuck the organizational bullshit.
	I am drinking about 5-7 cups of coffee a day. It is one of my sole pleasures, besides the trees and the wind and the mountains and Karen and Tim. K. is stressed, not getting along w/ the director. I think she and Tim are going to start their own company some day.
	Back to work. I’m scheduling a massage for the day before I leave here. I can’t wait. The beacon of strength.
Love,
Lis
I think you handled my little tantrum well.


 
October 24, 1988 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
	I feel compelled to write you again and tell you, in a letter that doesn’t call you scumbag, that I didn’t mean to be a bitch. Sorry, man. And I don’t at all think you life is shitty. I hope you know that. I am on a train watching a sunset. I am going home. I looked forward to this day during the last 3 weeks of frenzy and stress. I was right – here I sit, suddenly it’s over, and I’m thinking what the hell just happened? I did actually get the show up after all. Moments there where I was in a panic, or almost. But it got done, even though I worked til the very last minute and could have done a hundred more things. But all things considered I was very happy with the results. Took pictures yesterday after the show, crossing my fingers that they’re decent so I’ll have something to show for my work. It was great to realize that I could do a show, start to finish. One of the things that has always worried me about myself – wondering whether I was capable of bringing things to completion; always the feeling that my work was somehow unfinished – writing, art, music – always fragments. Now a whole. Yee haw. So. I’ve decided it’s time to slow down. Time to think and feel a little. Even sitting on a this train I am bombarded with thoughts and feelings – actual uninterrupted streams of thought and feeling… That is something I miss. Of course it means facing thoughts and feelings that are not always joyous. But I’d rather deal with the pains than ignore them. I was/am pretty upset because two people with whom I became friends this summer were in town at different times while I was in Lenox and didn’t get in touch with me, even knowing I was there. Of course I can rationalize that people are busy, things come up… Which is true. But this is the crucial time with people like that when it remains to be seen whether the friendship will live or die over distance. So here I am continuing to care as if there were no distance, and expecting the same. Expecting the same kind of feeling, the same heat from other people, then seeing that it might not be there. Seeing that maybe I was the only one who was strongly affected. Can’t seem to find a middle ground between undying faith in the feeling of a relationship and assuming for my own protection that there is nothing there. But then to counterbalance these disappointments were the people I did see, Naomi and Carol, who I know are reciprocating my feelings. Is it random chance that the disappointments are men and the unfailing ones women? Is there maybe a greater risk for men to express a connection? Do they just not care, not want to invest in a friendship? I really don’t know, but I hate the thought of having to give up on someone who has affected me, tell myself to stop putting out energy when it is not returned. Pretty much sucks all around. But I haven’t given up yet. Margaret said there was a letter from one of the guys who was here, so at least he is making some kind of effort… So, Bri, this is the life of the moment [?]. I feel old and familiar pains, after a long time of not having time to feel them. So in a way it is a good thing. I see you.
Love,
Lis

People who wouldn’t take emotional risks were frustrating. On the other hand, I don’t think it was exactly a conscious decision on our part either.


 
October 28, 1988 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa ––––––––
	It’s 1:00 am Saturday, and though I’ve only been up 12 hours, I am exhausted. But I just now thought of the beginning of this letter and jumped at the chance before I became tired again. I have been wanting to write every day since your last letter, and before that, too. It would be so nice to see you, but I suppose this will have to do. I have been having a conversation with you running through my head since whenever, or at least my half – little bits of ideas or phrases that need to be said to you. Something of a weight, after awhile, but never at the right time until now. I tried writing a few days ago, but the weight was not there and it seemed pointless. All I could manage was one sentence which, reading it now, seems canned, since it was at the time, only a recollection of a part of the half-conversation I have been having. Hope this makes sense. I could write about letter-writing all day. It’s one of those things about me that I cannot understand. I approach writing letters with such intense preparation. But enough on that…
	Your “you need to get out more” letter has been with me this whole time, too. To some degree, it is perhaps responsible for the strength of my desire to talk with you. Surely we do need to talk. This constant exchange of letters will drive me nuts soon. We seem to have accumulated enough tension to drop pretenses, at least for awhile. At least, I would like to. Perhaps a good fight is in order; anything besides the detached concern at which we have become so proficient.
	I went around for a week telling everyone I knew how embarrassed they should be to seen with someone as “dull and hellish” as I. Couldn’t have been more than three or four people though. Suffice it to say that I didn’t return your letter out of concern that you wouldn’t have a copy to refer to.
–––––––––––––
	Well. I wrote all that in one short burst and now my hand hurts. I know there are all these other things I have been wanting to tell you about. Evan coming back from another Forum adventure, Carolyn’s visit here from school, specific thoughts from specific moments that I cannot for the life of me recall. I am never able to summon thoughts, they will only consent to crashing in at the oddest times. I am sometimes fearful that all those times in the middle of the night when I sit up and think “this is it, this is the truth” about something, actually are the truth. I repeat them over and over till I think I have memorized them, but I have only memorized the feeling, the sensation of clarity, only rarely the idea itself.
	All I can think of now is the depth of my love for you and my fear of having forced another person (female especially) into an either/or situation and my desire not to allow myself to shut you out in order to avoid pain. Which amounts to the most honest thing I have written in quite awhile. Quite satisfyingly, too. You don’t know how desperately I wish we were together, here in the middle of this Boston night,. Evan and I will be in VA for Thanksgiving.
love,
Brian

The last paragraph was too emotional for me to send right away. I was worried that I was repeating a dysfunctional pattern. A bad road I had walked before.

Dear Lisa –––––––
	I am sick of letters. This is my 4th try at this one. Can’t take it. I would like to see you very much instead. I am sending this only because I am concerned that you would take silence as an indication of anger, which is incorrect. I will be home for Thanksgiving. Do you think you will be free someday around there? By the way THIS SITUATION SUCKS. Thank you. I love you.
B.

I gave up trying to write a real letter and sent this instead.

January 8, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	Here is a letter I found on the floor while cleaning my room. Thought you might like to have it considering our conversations regarding unsent letters. Hopefully you can see why I didn’t send it at the time – it is so full of my own struggling that it seemed doubtful that it would communicate anything of value to you. I know you find that idea silly, but I believe it is true. I’ll send you more if I find any other good ones.
love
Brian

I think we met in DC over Christmas and talked about my propensity for unsent letters, so I sent you the one from October after I got back to Boston. You received it after you had already started writing your next letter to me, which is why the dates appear out of order here.

 
January 6, 1989 – From Lisa
Dear Brian what the hell. It’s already two a.m. might as well make it three. I see two movies about love and I am in a dream state. all the while despairing at the wretchedness of reality. Things don’t work out. I love movies. It was good seeing you for more than once, for more than one hour. Having this party, which happens tomorrow, has made me realize that I have one friend here. The rest are gone. I believe I will wear a miniskirt. The hostess with the mostess.
I am reading Hemingway, the sun also rises. It is about love. Everything is about love. I am listening to Joan.
I thought about going to a bar after work this evening. Maybe next week.
Oh, Bri.

1 8 89 
I didn’t wear a miniskirt. I was so respectable in appearance. in fact that someone said to me, Lisa, you have been dressing differently, your image has changed. You look nice. Luckily for him I have known this person since age three. Dear Brian I am tortured. Writing sucks, writing is painful. All this shit that I have to drag up from dark places in order to discover what it is I really want to say. It hurts. But I am sure that it will pay.
I am ragged. There were brief shining moment at the party moment when I connected with people. Why is it all so vital to me? Why the fuck fuck fuck do I care?
At least, certainly, I am never bored.

1 20 
Certainly, I am never bored, but my restlessness grows daily. I feel myself failing.
About your letter. I have always gotten an f for failure at detached concern. Either I don’t give a fuck or it kills me. I am happy that you sent that letter. Send more. My brain is fucked, my heart is fucked. Even writing this to you now begins to seem senseless. What is left, for christ’s sake’?
I love you,
–––– Lis

Is it fair to send depressing shit letters to people you love??
I am unfair. This refers solely to the enclosed.

You were right about “detached concern”. I only used that phrase because reading/writing letters felt too distant at that moment.




 
January 27, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Lisa
	It’s 2:00 am and I am exhausted, but I was just now seized by the desire to write this on my way to bed. I have been reading this old paranoid science fiction book, so I suppose I am kind of wired from it. I wanted to go to sleep but I was stricken with the fear that the clarity of the last 5 minutes of my life would mean nothing to me tomorrow. I promise to send this regardless of how stupid it seems in the morning.
	I am amazed sometimes (e.g. now, for instance) at the duality of life. There is every day reality, and there is this – this clarity of immense dimensions. Peter sees it as black and white: There are people who understand and there are people who are merely extras. It frightens me, though I know it’s not strictly true, how accurate that view is. But what drives me crazy is that instead of being helpful and empowering, all clarity does is isolate me from the world. I have to fight so hard just to barely understand what’s going on in a world I have left behind. Instead of becoming independent, I am merely alienated. And the thrill of the new world, which was so overpowering a few years ago, is commonplace now. The panic, the intense upward climb of a series of understood moments with another person – I’m afraid now that it leads nowhere. Or that this is a plateau I have exhausted while the next one is beyond my reach. Certainly beyond my desire to chase after it as though it was free for the asking. Still I suppose I would die before giving up, not out of morality, but simply because it is a ride I do not control.
	Your letter tore me apart when I first read it. I had to rest for a minute afterwards. So frustrating to feel your words so deeply and be unable to reply at once. But even when we are together I don’t think we help each other any. I think that is what I meant by “detached concern”. It destroys me to feel so close to you, to feel so intensely understood, and at the same time understand that that closeness itself prohibits us from reaching a peak, sexual, spiritual or otherwise. The impotence of our relationship mocks me every time I go away from you. But, of course, it is the same with everyone else I know, though usually to a lesser degree. Maybe it is just me that’s impotent.
	Anyway, sorry to be so depressing. I think I finally understand that I can throw myself against you as hard as I want, and you will not flinch. I don’t think there’s anyone else on the planet who has ever offered me that, and I treasure it more than you could possibly know. The world is full of flinchers, I’m afraid. God knows I’ve met my share.
	2:50 am now. Fifty fucking minutes to write this crap. I hope it means something to you. Fuck. So no I am blurry with exhaustion and still I am burning. I know that this letter is off the mark because there is no satisfaction in finishing it. I wish you were here – I would hold you and not let you go till morning.
love
Brian

This is not a bad letter, considering how desperate I felt.


 
February 19, 1989 – From Lisa
Dearest Brian, 
So maybe the understanding isn’t supposed to lead anywhere. Maybe it just is. Maybe it is a peak in its very constancy. No, you are not impotent. Your letter moved me. It moves me to be thought of as one who does not flinch. It verifies the purpose of my existence.
So it’s been a while since I got that letter. My inspiration for writing has been low but that doesn’t mean I love you any less. I have only been in a funk of blueness and stress that has kept me from letting things flow out of me. So much so that I can hardly breathe. It got worse today when I thought it should be better, having had a weekend off. But my chest felt so constricted that I worried about being in the house alone and went out to Olsson’s and browsed. That took my mind off my body until I happened to be looking at an astrology book which explained the effects of Saturn in conflict with Uranus. Mine happen to be in conflict, directly opposite each other. The conflict manifests itself in Uranus ruling breathing and the nervous system, in sallow breathing and asthma, especially when outlets for expression are restricted. So I read this and said shit, man…
This weekend was my first day off in two weeks. It felt like a reawakening finally being able to get back to that nebulous plane of existence that I have had to push aside, that is so vital to me. No wonder I feel constrained, having had to exist on the level of the mundane, being bombarded with the real. I wasn’t meant for so much reality. Life needs more poetry. I need more poetry. It is what I thrive on and it is what is considered useless by so many. The things for which there is no direct translation, nor should there be. Ah. the convoluted sentence. I feel like doing artsy things like hanging out at the Space. I just got my hair cut. It’s wicked short and I feel so fine. Along with recovering some of my senses and my spirit I’ve recovered a lot of my sense of restlessness. I’m at another turning point, or approaching one with the end of the season. The world is before me. I am relatively clueless but completely exhilarated. Will I ever settle down? I wouldn’t mind being able to do one thing for longer than six months… If only I were less poor. I did my taxes last week and realized that last year my income didn’t even make it into the five-digit range. Does that suck big raw eggs or what? I’m practically at fucking poverty level. And I still have to pay more taxes. Jesus.
I spoke with Tahir today and my throat started to hurt from talking so much. I am tired of being so fucking reticent. I like talking. Tahir will be here in March for a week and my throat will be even more sore. Yeehah.
Write me more. It’s a good thing. There are things I wish I understood better but I’ll be sure to grill you when I see you next. I’m feeling slightly flaky right now. Maybe because I’m listening to John Denver. Forgive me. I’ll see you.
Love,
Lis

This letter speaks to me – especially the part about being forced to live in mundane reality. Neither of us were comfortable in that world, but we did eventually adapt to it well enough.
 
February 28, 1989 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
	It’s 11:30 pm Monday, and I have successfully avoided interior monolog for about three hours here in front of the TV. Evan is gone to California to visit his family and sister Aryn in particular who has cancer, which you have hopefully been advised of already under separate cover, since I am going to just skip right past it. It occurred to me in the bathroom between ads that I might be lonely sitting here mindlessly. But I don’t act it – I drove my friend Jody home from work because his car is getting fixed. He asked me to stay for dinner with him and his wife Ellen, but I left after a beer because I wanted to be alone. I don’t know why I wanted to be alone. Less pressure I suppose. It was already 8:00 by the time I got back into the car. I was surprised it was so late. On the way to Jody’s house I had mentioned to him that I was going to write a story about my trip to Hoboken this weekend. Not because anything particularly exciting had happened. It was more just that a bunch of normal things happened, and they stuck together in my mind as a whole.
	I almost missed the train back yesterday. I was the last one to get on, just as it pulled out of Penn Station. There seemed to be plenty of time when I left Jeff’s, but the clock outside the station said 4:04 and the train was for 4:14. I thought it was maybe ten till at the latest. But I hurried and nearly fucked up several times (couldn’t find the right track at first) and they closed the line off right behind me and a conductor said “oh shit” and pointed to a door on the train that had not been closed yet and I ran and made it. I banged my bag on a column running and felt it hard and solid. There were no seats, and I worried that I had broken something in the bag.
	Jeff talked me into a new book before I left, and I figured that was what I had hit. We had been planning to into the city for dim sum, but the weather was lousy and we had no energy and ate at a diner in Hoboken instead. I almost tried for the 1:15 train, but decided to wait for the later one, because I didn’t want to have to rush to make it. Jeff, I think, was disappointed by our not getting dim sum – he had been talking about it all weekend. But by then we were just passing time, so I don’t think it bothered him right away. 
	The night before I had stayed up till 4:00 am reading his girlfriend Jen’s copy of a Kurt Vonnegut book. I tried to go to sleep at 2:00, but couldn’t so I turned on the light and finished the book. It had been several hours since Jeff left me to go sleep in his room. Andy was gone and I was alone in his room. I was burning like mad, I couldn’t stand it. I can’t remember now about what, but it was quite clear then and I wanted to write it down very much, but didn’t. Now it is gone, like 99% of the other things I have ever felt or gone through. I do remember recalling these kids I used to hang out with when I was 15 or so. They lived in my development, but not in our immediate neighborhood. I used to bike down there when I was bored on summer nights. They were all a lot younger than me, maybe 11 or 12 or so, and I was very much the strange outsider to them. I rode a ten-speed, and they were on kids’ dirt bikes or whatever they’re called. It was very frightening to suddenly remember being with them, it came back to me as a whole: the feeling of those summer nights, not wanting to worry my parents, but loving the night and the breeze as I rode more and more as it went on [sic]. I wondered what other things I have forgotten whole like that, to be remembered in 5 years or 15 or never.
	We hadn’t really done anything at all that evening, even though it was Saturday. Maybe that’s why I stayed up so late. We listened to music and read our books. Jeff showed me some things he had recently written for Interview and The New Yorker. At one point my eyes landed on a painting hanging there on a wall. I asked him what it was of, and he said “stairs going up” and I thought it was pretty good. He told me it was yours, and I was struck by the gratitude I knew he must feel to be able to have it like that on his wall. I couldn’t understand why he didn’t right then get up to call and thank you for it, and I told him so. He explained that it wasn’t that simple, that it was better for you not to trust him, because he knew that in the future it would be impossible for him to come through for you like you wanted. I was pissed, but I could see that he was right. I cursed you for loving him so much, and cursed myself for wishing that you didn’t. I couldn’t understand how anyone could love him more than me, but I had been down that path before and went back to the book.
	That afternoon we had left Karen in Andy’s car. We were coming back from the mall. Manhattan looked like it was just around the corner. I thought the twin towers were part of an even bigger mall. We decided to get out at the record store instead of going home with Andy. We intended Karen to get out too, but in the end she stayed in the car so Andy could drive her to the bus to go home. “This isn’t what I intended” Jeff said to me as they drove off. We hadn’t even said goodbye really.
	The night before, at the party I had come down for, Jeff and I had got into a stupid argument about her.
[not finished]

This is kind of nice in a dreamy, meandering way. I like how the story runs backwards in time. Probably not great for a letter, but it does eventually get around to you, quite pointedly. I never sent it.






 
March 24, 1989 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
	Sorry it has taken me so long to write: I have been too busy watching TV. Today I watched MTV long enough to see the same videos come around again. Impressed? That’s what convinced me that I had to do something different, like writing this. So I turned off the volume and put on a CD: make-your-own video. Got a bottle of champagne from the fridge. Been sitting there since Christmas. With any luck I’ll be largely incoherent by the end of this letter and all these words will mean nothing, like they’re supposed to.
	Took a roll of photos of myself in the mirror. A whole roll. Evan is in Philly with his chick, so he couldn’t stop me. Art, man, fucking awesome. I couldn’t figure out what else to do. I had already watched about three hours of TV by that point. I was a choice between that and going to sleep, because I couldn’t think of anything else to do. I was about 10:30 then. It’s 12:50 now. I’m on glass #3. Stay tuned. I swear, is there anything interesting left on this planet? I must’ve fucked around with every interesting idea I’ve encountered at least once. What more is there? If they had told me when I was 20 that everyone died within a month of graduating from college, I wouldn’t have been surprised. I can’t believe that four years of pure spiritual battery is just the beginning of sixty years or so of life. No direction, no point, just overcome the pain if you can. And believe in true love, it’s your one hope. Right? Right?
	That’s what I was thinking when I was taking photos. It occurred to me also that true love is pretty bummed when it shows up and you have, like a double chin and an actual true-to-life beer belly. Perhaps that’s the only real reason not to just sit around on your ass all day. Not because you’re missing out, but because you become so bloated it begins to interfere with other areas in which laziness is key. Like climbing stairs, which I can’t anymore without having to breathe through my mouth once I get to the top. Anyway, it’s been on my mind these days. Live right or die, I can accept that. Glass five or so, by the way, can you tell? It’s 1:10. Man, I’m starving. Burning inside too, rocking back and forth with the music. Maybe that is the point after all. Who cares if I get fat and croak?
	[Paragraph skipped]
	Karen was here this week, and I suppose I’m ticked at her too. No point in going into details, but we seem to have gone from being close to being not close inside of a few weeks. Guess I should bring that up with her, not you. It’s 1:40, by the way, in case you’re keeping track. Have I ever written you this much before?
	Well, I promise now to send this regardless of how crappy it seems in the morning. I have worn this pencil down to a stub. If you write me back to tell me to get out more I will come down there and pound on you. I love you so much, you may be the only real person on the planet. Congratulations.
love,
Brian

Another long, unsent letter. I was in an unusually bad mood. Some of it is OK, considering, but it’s still not something you can mail to a friend the next day.




 
April 2, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
       Evan bought me new pens. Life is pointless without good pens. I have written you a ton recently, but it has all be CRAP, so there. Perhaps I will dig some of it up again before I send this, and I will see if it is still crap. My sister was in D.C. last week and said that she was going to call you, but didn’t. Don’t know why. We did agree that you were a wonderful and worthy individual. I bought the new Throwing Muses album and it is way good. I will send you a tape. What would you like on the other side? I have been having this particularly impossible correspondence with a friend from high school, and when it became clear that I was incapable of anything more in words I sent her a tape instead. Speaks volumes, I’m hoping. I may communicate exclusively in audio tape from now ow. I sent Peter one, too.
       Well, that pretty much explains my life. All in one ¶. I have been having all these dreams, too. I’m coming to believe that they all fit together into this big dream world where I really live. They always have the same feel, and I can tell right before I wake up how they have been designed to reveal me to everyone else in the dream world. We are all made of parts in my dream world and it can be quite satisfying. Everything is more important than in this world. It takes no effort at all to realize how important everything is. Whereas, in this world, it’s fucking impossible half the time. Good dreams, these. I’m fond of nightmares, too, when they come. Why do people complain about nightmares?
       A fucking novel, that last ¶. Hopefully you just skipped to the end after a few sentences. Didn’t really cover anything else at the end. I’m mad at Karen, too. I had forgotten what it’s like to be hurt by someone I care about. Surprising. But I am being cool, that is my style. Not like school when I flipped out at every little thing. This is much better. Nothing that could be done anyway, in this particular case. No malice aforethought, as they say.
       Anyway, I still love you uncontrollably. It’s kind of hard. Actually I sometimes wish I didn’t, but fortunately there is no choice involved. Just recognition. May be down sometime soon. My folks are building a beach house in Ocean City [sic], and we can go. Yea! Talk to you.
love,
Brian

This is not a very good letter, but at least it was something I could send without instant regret. The friend from high school was Missy.

so bloody old…
3-7-89
Dear Brian,
       How are you man? I sat nude in a jacuzzi for an hour the other night. This was after a 3-hour long dinner at an Afghani restaurant with M. & Eugenia. It was all lovely. That night I had a dream about the purest love imaginable. I was unutterably happy. Then it was Monday morning.
       Now it is Tuesday afternoon and I’m still sane. Work is double the stress I thought it would be since my draper is out w/ strep and I am taking her place. Fittings are next week. Shit.
       But I’m keeping myself in a sanguine state, for the moment, at least, partly with the help of a photograph of me smiling on my 5th birthday, sitting on the porch with a plate of gingerbread men in front of me. I keep it on my board at work, along with a little one-word reminder: sanity. One of these days I will be blissful. One day soon…
       When you coming home?
       The real question is – what kind of car should I buy? Some time this summer I’ll drive up and see you.
       I think last I wrote I had no plan for the summer. I still have no plan but the anticipation of my fans is mounting.
Meanwhile, Elvis Costello tickets went on sale Friday and I don’t have any, mainly because I couldn’t drum up any interest. How sad. No hip friends. Oh man, I just remember that I met Joan Armatrading in my dream last night. Pretty cool, but meeting Elvis was cooler. I am on the verge of buying Green. My latest acquisition was Hunkpapa. Throwing Muses. I’ve been strumming my guitar. Remember Richard Bach – Illusions. Picking up a guitar, having never played, and being great…
	I miss talking about nebulous things. Margaret & Eugenia and I had a great talk over dinner, not about the nebulous, but inspiring nonetheless. We talked about our perceptions of ourselves, ways we communicate, relate to others. The trials of being socialized as women to defer in arguments, never to interrupt, etc. Feeling intimidated intellectually because it is often assumed that women know less. Underestimating our strengths. Not solely because we are women. Part of it is family and for M & me, deafness. It all made me think.

pretty new…
4-2-89
Dearest Brian, I miss you. It seems like forever since I saw you. A lot of things seem like forever. I feel like getting in a car (5 speed Toyota Celica, which I crave) and driving up, up, up I95. I’ll be unemployed come May 5th. We’ll also be having a party that night. You are most invited. Come back! Kira, Mary, and Tahir are trying to get me out to Chicago to visit and/or live. It tempts me (the living), but not urgently. Now Karen will be in Boston. That tempts me, too. I’m getting my shit together, but I refuse to do anything that sucks and compromises my ideals. Fucking idealist. Jesus, no wonder I rattle around so often.
	Tomorrow I am telling my hairdresser to cut my hair as short as he can without making me ugly. I don’t want to scare myself in the mirror.
	Oh geez louise I don’t want to write I want to see you. I want to be stupid with you.
	Tahir was here for a week and he was a goofball. I am no longer the calming, restraining influence on him that I once was. Now he reveals his goofiness in any given moment. I like it. I realized having him here that my life had been lacking in the kind of closeness that envelops you like water. I realized how draining it is for me to be out of touch with people I care about. I resolved to make it more of a priority, since it is so much what I am about.
	Spring fever. I have spring fever.
       I went to an astrologer last night. Quite a thing.
	What to do, what to do? I am researching the job market as well as schools. Time for that blessed change, any blessed change…
	My mind is distracted. I wanted to tell you I love you.
	I’ll be seeing you. Tell me what you are going through.
Love,
Lis

Dearest Brian,
       Our letters crossed. I think we even wrote on the same day but I carried mine around for a few days and finally sent it. But your letter compelled me to write again. So, you’ve been writing a lot of crap… I just haven’t been writing much at all because a lot of what I’ve had to say has been whiney. And boring. Not that what I did finally send was scintillating, but I was at least in a frame of mind that was possessed of a little clarity and direction.
       I have been dreaming shitloads but having trouble remembering. This has been going on for about 2 or 3 weeks. Maybe because I am constantly sleep-deprived. I don’t remember the last night I got enough sleep. Last night a dream of two ex-lovers, one who sent me a letter saying, among other things, “I hate you,” and another whom I kissed, who then disappeared, leaving me with no idea when I would see him again. I also saw Karen in my dream, and she was very vivid and colorful. I told her how pretty she looked. I’m sorry that things are pissy with her. We all must bear some prissiness… Does coolness work for you? I have yet to discover how it works for me because my personal relationships have been almost sadly devoid of strife lately. I’d almost welcome a good turmoil, just for the extremity of it. Almost.
       Things get better. There’s a lot of going through my mind, possibilities. I’m starting to get the bigger picture, starting to see myself more wholly. Believe it or not, seeing an astrologer helped me to start doing that because it gave me new ways of looking at things. Not that it offered answers, but it started me thinking from different angles, and that is giving me some answers. I love the process of questioning, the cycles of growth.
       4-8 Lucid dreaming, do you lucid dream? I think we have talked about it before. I am string trying to control my dreams…
       Anyway, Brian, Brian. It’s Saturday a.m. and I’m fucking on my way to work. Fuck. Tomorrow is my one day off and I will be marching in the NOW march. Shitloads to do, but this is important to me. My friends are shitting [?] out on me, though, because they have too much to do!!!
       It doesn’t look like I’ll be working at the Post. Bad timing. So what? I have some other ideas, though, that I’m psyched about…
Sun night. Today a coolness day. I got up a few hours after having retired, and felt extreme. I went alone to the NOW march. It was great. I felt myself making a difference.
	I am listening to the Throwing Muses. They are truly excellent. I saw them at the 9:30 the other night and they were amazing. I was inspired. Also infinitely fascinated by looking around me and listening to people talk. I was standing outside waiting for Eugenia, watching a bunch of students filing in and I caught myself thinking, don’t they have homework to do? Shit. Did I feel old or what? Of course my shaved head fit right in… So anyway, I bought the new album as soon as it was out, but thanks for the tape offer… An interesting form of expression…
	Things are happening. One of them is that my handwriting is getting to be atrocious. I am agitated in a good way.
	11:30 PM. Karen is here!! She’ll be on her way over soon. Aaah! I’m psyched. What a fucking cool day…
	I think I’m on the verge of something amazing. I’ve waited long enough for it, I’d say… Now I’m extremely agitated.
	So are you coming to our party?? May 5th, Friday night. You and Evan should road trip for it. DO IT!!
I love you. Ain’t that the coolest?
Write me more. I love your letters. Kira thinks your handwriting is beautiful. She likes your letters too. We agree. You are beautiful.
Love,
Lis

I like that this covers a month of time. It feels like a slice of your life.







 







 
April 8 (or so), 1989 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	This is my letter to you: Karen is moving to Chicago. I suppose that is enough to make you move there too. To which I say: Don’t. Move here. We can move to Chicago next year if we have to. I made Evan and myself excellent gin and tonics. We are drinking them now. He is watching TV, something about Satan and a group of sorority girls. God, I love cable. Karen and Tim and I went to a movie tonight. Good flick. She is leaving tomorrow. I think Tim called me “Bill”. Pointless goodbye, etc. Thought of Sue in the middle of the movie and almost started to cry. Pointlessness. Driving home with the windows down. Cold night, heaters blasting in the car, like Peter always used to drive. Hoping the cops would pull me over, I remembered that windows down in the cold is a sign of a drunk driver. And I would have a good reason, ‘cause I was thinking of my best friend.
	That is all. Come visit. We miss you infinitely. Etc.
love,
Brian

When the weather was cold and Peter was in a good mood, he would sometimes drive with the windows down and the heat blasting (with me in the passenger seat). It seemed indefensibly self-indulgent, but it felt great.

 
April 18, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	I bought construction paper. Gonna make something, I don’t know what. Got glue, too. If Kira likes my handwriting why doesn’t she write me? Question mark. Huh? Why not then? God knows I can always use yet another correspondence with some female I never actually see.
	Pointlessness. It is 12:30 in the morning and I am just now awake after a whole day of working and watching TV and eating. Why does everything choose to kick in now? I ask you. Which is real, the working or the sitting here now wallowing in myself? Feeling alone but alive. I used to have no doubt, but now I am not so sure. Being this way might be romantic, but it is just as surely incapacitating. Stay up another hour. Put on another record. Smoke another cigarette. Get fat and explode long before I find salvation.
	Eccentric romantic passion indulgent disease. I’ve got it. There’s no one waiting for me. Maybe thinking of me, but not counting on me. No one in my bed asleep for me. It’s a big bed. Isolated detached aware soulful suffering doesn’t burn many calories. But, hey, virtue is its own fucking reward, right? Plus, if you call now, lung cancer, no extra charge. Regretting everything, keeping track of every time I hurt someone I love. Repeating them to myself late at night so I don’t forget any. Shocked sometimes to stumble upon a whole group, a time in my life which I had forgotten. All the little worlds of my childhood, before they became one. Missing myself and people who are gone for me or just dead. Some of whom I treated with respect and care. Some of whom who did not want to be respected. Some who were afraid to love, who could love in parts but not in the whole. Repeating mistakes. Mastering them. Polishing the steps along them. Hoping that someone somewhere was taking notice of my worthiness, in the absence of any concrete satisfactions.
	Please don’t write back to tell me to get out more. And don’t tell me I’m OK, either. I know exactly how OK I am. Just write and pour yourself out to me again and we will keep it going.
	This letter includes you. You’re one of them. Explain yourself. Have a nice day.
love,
Brian

Using dark construction paper as stationery was not one of my better ideas. I don’t think I ever made anything interesting with it, either. It sat mostly unused in my desk for years.
At this point, I could see that loneliness was affecting my physical and mental health, and that unhealthiness was one reason I was lonely. Dumping it out on paper was a way to get out of the loop, if only temporarily.



 
May 5, 1989 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
	In some ways I feel like I’ve already left. Maybe because of the feeling that it is futile to try and connect with people in a meaningful way. Maybe because I expect too much. Maybe because I am agonized and neurotic. I’m not getting the feeling that it pays to tell people truths. I am knotted with unease. People have the attention span of a newt.
	I stood out on the balcony tonight in wetness getting air, getting out. Our party bore witness to the fact that our set is getting old. People don’t stay up, people don’t talk, people don’t take risks. It depresses me to all hell. Was I looking for too much? Maybe. But wouldn’t you still be up, living? Jesus. What’s gotten into me?
	I fucking hate saying goodbye. It doesn’t say enough, nearly. But I suppose I bring it upon myself by leaving. Why am I bitter? Wishing you were here. I haven’t been this bitter in a long time. People just aren’t cutting it.

5-25-89
Dearest Bri, I write to you now from a different balcony, Kira’s in Evanston. I have been in houseguest hell for the past 2 weeks. Tomorrow I make my fifth move, then still one more before I can get settled into my own apartment. Shit. This sucks. It is the worst feeling to be shuffled around. The logistics of it are not pretty; Karen got saddled with me when plans to stay with Kira were changed at the last minute because of some family goings-on. Then Karen kicked me out when Tim came to visit, and asked me not to come back. Mary’s sister Cathy took me in and made me feel like less of a loser. Then I came to Evanston, for what I thought would be the rest of my time before my lease starts, only to be asked to leave tomorrow since Kira’s mom is coming home. Fuck, man. If I had know this I wouldn’t have come out so frigging early. But I got the distinct impression that everything was perfectly arranged. Anyway, enough bitching. At least I got to spend some time with Tahir on the way out here.
	Another thing that sucks: Looking for a job without a home to look from. I am, however, working part time at the circus. I subbed for Karen last weekend as an usher because she couldn’t start yet since Tim would be here, and now I’m a permanent sub, which is perfect since I need money but don’t want to commit to full-time. People there are cool, from Canada. I wish I spoke French. But most speak some English. I am completely taken with a guy named Francois. He is a technician. He makes me laugh. He looks like a sailor. We’re going to hang out after the show tomorrow. He said – hang out? What does that mean? I’m psyched. What sucks is that no matter what, he will leave when the circus leaves, in one month. My relationships with people have been so transient for the last couple years. I get tired of it, but I suppose I could choose to stay in one place for longer than 6 months. I just hate knowing that separation is imminent. I never seem to be able to keep caring and time in proportion. Suddenly everything matters too fucking much and I get screwed. Even with women.
	What else? I’m poor. And I don’t think I’ll find the job I’m looking for for a while yet, so I’ll probably temp, either in theater or, god forbid oh no fucking way, as a receptionist. I think I’d rather do manual labor, though… I’m checking out some arts publications right now, thinking about looking into internships since I have no hard experience in the field. Talked with Steve Johnson ’86 at the Tribune but I think I’d rather do magazine than newspaper work…
	We’re having a party June 17th. Wanna come? Housewarming. Probably sans furniture…
So how are you, Bri? I miss you. Sorry I couldn’t come through Boston on my way out here… Tell me how you are.
I love you.
Love,
Lis

June 3, 1989 – From Lisa
Dearest Brian, 
I just wrote to you, so terribly recently, and yet you are still the only one I feel like talking to now. Still wishing you were here but this old machine serves me pretty well. No disgusting insinuation intended. I’m so happy to have my typewriter back at my disposal. I am sitting on my spanking new futon drinking a Beck’s dark after a long, wearing day on the job. Spent the last couple hours hanging out with Karen at her place. First time we’ve had a chance to hang in a long time, despite the fact that we are working together. Funny how we keep ending up in the same place… I like it. I like being here. I am alone a great deal of the time, which is good for me. Tomorrow I get a housemate, one I haven’t met. And I don’t mind. Ain’t that grand? I am way mutable. My feet have been cold for some time now. Should I build a fire? I have no hot water until Monday.
Did I tell you I’m going to be on the cover of Muscle and Fitness? Decided I was cut out for body building and joined a gym. I imagine myself with definition. I imagine myself defined.
My room has seven walls, a fine number. Seven. Not much else will fit in my room besides my futon, which has the foresight to fit two. 
I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing. At least I know that I can type sixty words per minute, and that makes me happy. Job, I need a job, when all I want is to be able to do what I want. Shit, man. I am supposing that come Monday I’ll get my hot little hands on the phone and get off my big ass and make myself a job. I’ve been sort of avoiding the real act of getting a job, hoping to buy some clarity with the passing days. Clarity eludes me. Especially as I swig my beer.
I haven’t been going out much lately. I have wanted to see Francois but we keep getting crossed. We did hang out that night, until the sun came up, but since then plans have gotten fucked up. It’s weird. I don’t even have a crush on the guy, I just want to be with him. Two more weeks. Two weeks to know someone or to say fuck, no fucking way, I’m not taking that risk. I’d rather know someone, but two people have to take risks at the same time, or else one gets fucked. Am I getting fucked? Am I even taking a risk? Should I ask him over for a dinner I can’t cook because I don’t have gas yet, and perhaps a nice cold shower? Have I already bitched to you about too much fucking transience? Yeah. It gets me. On the other hand I imagine permanence with one person, permanent intimacy, and part of me shits. But another part of me says oh yeah…
I am too bleary-eyed to continue. I do love you.
Love,
Lis

Starting over in a new city with no job isn’t fun. I’m glad you had some friends, at least.

 
June 12, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
       I promised myself I wouldn’t write you so much. Every time I pull a letter for Evan from you out of our mailbox. What a jealous bastard I am. You’re just going to marry Tahir anyway, as I recall. Freud would love me, I am so over-invested in platonic relationships. Anyway it is Sunday night 1:30 am and I have been watching MTV again most of the day. Not tired, wish I was. Joined the YMCA, going to start keeping normal hours and working out before work. It is terribly disappointing to find that the values that helped me understand adolescence would probably not keep me alive past 30 years. I swear, I must have said this a dozen times in different letters by now, but I am shocked to be alive at all. I never for a moment thought about being this old. Evan is 24. Half my friends are nearing 30 and married. And I can’t help but feel that anything that happens in the next 60-odd years will be nothing but epilog to the story of the last six or seven years. I fucking make it that way by protecting myself from risk at every turn. I doubt anything could ever overwhelm me again. I don’t even think I want to be overwhelmed. I want to fucking take over, myself and everything else. But I think that has only a very small chance of being a more interesting story than the one I have already experienced. We are all just going to disappear into history, all of us. Except Jeff who will probably become famous, for a while anyway. He is interviewing for the top music editor job at Rolling Stone. One of three people being considered. It really makes me sick what’s going on in China. Blows all this away. First time I can recall being really moved by current events since John Lennon died. Those kids could have been us. We would have been them without a second thought. I haven’t heard anyone compare it to Kent State, but that’s what it reminds me of. They’re all hippies, I think. Now they’re going to be dead hippies.
       So. There’s a bunch of big talk. I hate politics, makes everyone look like idiots regardless of what they’re really like. Handwriting is what’s important. I used to write slanted. I have been practicing it again, but it is hard to write in a straight line.
       Swan Swan Hummingbird
       Hurrah
       We are all free now
       What noisy cats are we.
I have pages and pages of diary entries that look like nothing but a herd of slanted lines. Don’t know why I switched to simple up and down. Bet you wish I’d shut up and go back to talking about China.
	Anyway, the reason I am writing any of this is really this. I just wrote this terribly unsatisfying letter to my friend Missy in VA. I keep wanting to write honestly, like I do to you, but am unable. Our friendship is based on us being witty and sensitive and intelligent, but not honest. And she writes these beautiful effortless letters. There is no room to fuck up, though I am sure that is not her intent. So of course I always wait till the last paragraph before blurting whatever it is that I really want to say. Makes for some of the most awkward letters since I stopped writing Sue. It’s cool though, because I think in reality the only awkwardness is that we never see each other and that just comes out as this bizarre need to write perfect letters. There is no chance to correct them in person. At least that’s what I hope. There have been a few transcendent moments with her, but they seem long ago and always in the context of some external social scene that we could escape from together. It’s harder when it’s just us and there is nothing to escape from. Isn’t this fucking fascinating for you? It’s almost over. You can skip to the next paragraph if you want. Here’s the end: Our mutual friend Marcia is getting married on the 24th and I am going to VA to attend. It’s complicated though because Peter might come too from Ohio and he and Missy used to be very serious a long time ago. Plus, Marcia and I always had this thing for each other, so it annoys me that she is up and getting married before we had a chance to sleep together. Sorry, honest truth. Plus, she and her new hubby are moving here after they get hitched. That’s it, it’s over.
	Is this the longest letter I have ever written to you? Certainly the most boring. Not even depressing or anything.
	2:30 am now. Here’s the other situation I can’t figure out. I will write it as smally as a I can to keep from boring you. Here, I’ll do it in numbers:
1. Gina was Sue’s roommate in Boston a year ago. May still be, I don’t know.
2. Gina attempted to kill herself and was committed temporarily.
3. While Gina was in the hospital, she and I started to become friends. Bizarre friends. Sue and I were still talking.
4. Around the time Gina left the hospital, Sue and I stopped talking.
5. Sue is Gina’s closest friend.
6. It became clear to me after Gina moved back into their apartment that Sue provided her no emotional support at all and basically cannot deal with her.
7. Every time I hung out with Gina, I just ended up mad at Sue for being such a weak bitch.
8. Eventually my desire to separate from Sue overwhelmed my desire to be close to Gina and I spontaneously blew her (Gina) off one day with no explanation.
There. Only eight steps. So anyway, now, six months later I have this terrible guilt over blowing Gina off. But I’m sure that there’s nothing I could do that wouldn’t just end up causing further pain to both of them. Plus, I haven’t talked to Sue in more than a year and don’t really want to go the rest of my life without seeing her. I even made her a tape. It would be best if they were not still living together so I could deal individually. Only David (Block) knows for sure, and it would cost me an emotional arm and leg to ask him.
	Then there’s the part about our cats I wanted to write, but my God it’s the end of page 5 already. What is with me? God my hand hurts. The thing about my cats is that I am starting to learn how to think like a cat, sort of. It’s fun. There’s more, but that’s the main point. Let’s not dwell on the cats.
	Here’s the part about you. I love you so much. I can feel it. It makes me sneeze. Honestly, I sneeze when I love people and they aren’t around to receive it. I get shivery and then my nose itches and I sneeze. 2:45 am now. I don’t know why I feel this way. I hate that you’re female. I would never love you this much if you weren’t. Isn’t that sick? I DON’T KNOW. I hope not.
love,
Brian
Oh, yeah, important P.S. Karen is a fucking bitch if she kicked you out for Tim. Especially considering how Evan and I took them both in so frequently. I hope I just misunderstood you, ‘cause I was appalled when I read your letter. She blew me off for him, too, and it really pissed me off. And there was nothing I could do and it hurt. Is she really so clueless? Either way, no one, including Tim, is worth screwing other people over for. Fucking soap opera. I hate being jealous.

I have no recollection of joining a YMCA, and I certainly never worked out before work. At least my intentions were good, I guess. I was trying to figure out how to take better care of myself.
“What’s going on in China” at the time was Tiananmen Square.
30 years later, I am still thinking about how to write to Missy (Melissa) in a way that’s true to myself. Some things don’t change. I’ve gotten better at it, at least.
Getting to know Gina as she recovered from a suicide attempt was a delicate, surprising experience, but it made things with Sue even weirder and more painful. I believe Gina actually lives in Chicago now.
I still sometimes sneeze when I think about you.










 
June 21, 1989 – From Lisa
Dear Brian, 
Your letter was truly excellent and fascinating. I was way psyched. I read it on the bus. I read it at work. I read it the next day on the bus.
Now I don’t take the bus and I don’t work. I am unemployed. The circus left Monday. We struck Sunday. Strike was cool. I wrote about it. If you are interested I’ll send you a copy, I said goodbye to people. Only one made me sad. Francois, the technician I hung with. I had decided to make a pass at him during the last week but didn’t. Then when we said goodbye we kissed and I could tell it would have been amazing. Shit. Fuck. Anyway, doing the tear down was a sort of purifying ritual, a way to let go gradually. I have difficulty letting go of people. Over-investment, maybe…
You probably already knew that.
I am in a good phase. I am remarkably calm, and I have a great deal of trust in myself. I feel open. Yet, I am still waiting to come across people who can really sense who I am.
Writing is making me happy. The piece on the circus is nearly finished. I consider it a remarkable breakthrough to have completed anything, with my propensity for scatteredness. And these days the channels for getting things out and onto paper feel clearer than they have in the part. The change has done me good.
I feel pretty much alone but I like it. It is reassuring to me to be alone and have so much going on inside. I love to sit in cafes alone, drinking coffee and writing. It is one of the joys of my existence. The other is getting your letters. I sneeze too. I didn’t know that anyone else did.
The thing that eats away at me is the nagging question: will I be able to pay the rent? But I still go out for coffee.
I am finding myself drawn toward photography, seeing things as if through a lens.
6 26 I am looking at life with more attention lately, probably because I have time to. I am going to take a photography class. The next in a string of media that fascinate me. I still feel like the one I couldn’t live without is writing, but other forms of art keep pulling at me too. I think that’s a good thing. I have gotten over my worry that I disperse my energy over too many media. That’s hogwash.
I still think that there are overwhelming things ahead of me, and ahead of you too. Sometimes no matter how hard you clench your teeth against it, something gets to you, gets under your skin.
Yes, Karen did blow me off for Tim. You didn’t misunderstand me. It is my feeling that Karen is going through a period of trying to deal with a long history of basing her actions on what would please other people. Not necessarily make them happy, but be acceptable. Now, it seems, she is closing herself off in a big way to try and compensate for so many years of not looking at what she really needed. I don’t like it; I feel alienated. I still love her. I don’t have time in our relationship to be pissed at her. That’s pointless. She is returning to Lenox next week to be with Tim there until September, when they will both supposedly return to Chicago to live. We’ll see what really happens.
One of my housemates is homophobic. She stated yesterday that homosexuality is a birth defect, and not something to be proud of. A fucking birth defect. I want to tell her that I am a lesbian.
I still don’t have a job. Margaret is sending me money. I have been spoiled by this time of freedom, this last week of living creatively and in the present. I am loathe to give that up, so I don’t kill myself looking for work. Isn’t that glorious? Will you be my sugar daddy?
Maybe I should escape to grad school. Can I get away with that? Yeah.
It doesn’t matter what sex I am. I love you. You love me. Fuck the rest. I’ll see you. Truth and beauty.
Love,
Lis
Make me a tape. I need more excellent music to live life by.

It worried me that I wrote to you with so much intensity. I had a pattern of unrequited platonic relationships with women that I didn’t want to repeat again.


 
July 1, 1989 – From Brian (unsent)
DEAR LISA,
	The goddamned update: I went home for Marcia’s wedding. It was beautiful; she almost acted like she really wanted to get married. Spent most of the weekend with Missy. It was incomprehensible. We were mad when we parted, but it’s hard to say over what. Just basic not-getting-along, I guess, but then I can’t figure out why we’d spend all that time together. Peter was there and he just ended up disgusted with her. It was bizarre. Peter is the greatest. Let me tell you. It’s weird between us, I don’t know that our lives overlap much any more, but it doesn’t really bother me. The core is still there.
	Went to Sue and Gina’s one Saturday night at about 1:30 am. They still live together, same place they used to. Sat under a street light wondering whether I would go and ring the bell. A light was on in the apartment. Wondering what I was doing there at all. These two drunken assholes walked by and ascertained that they didn’t like me sitting there under the streetlight for no apparent reason. They asked me to move. I refused. They whacked me. I yelled. They ran. Gina came outside to see. I apologized to Gina. She gave me ice. Sue was in Chicago, I tried not to wonder why. I had a black eye for a week.
	All truth. What a fucking life. Drives me nuts not being able to understand WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON! I find no peace anymore, just self-perpetuating chaos.
	Find enclosed a tape. I don’t know what you already have, so I just put on stuff I thought you’d like. Punk folk pop, that kind of thing.
	Please find the time in your relationship to be pissed at Karen. How else is she going to figure out that her new approach to life is a fucking disaster? I hope she chokes on whatever’s up her ass. Maybe you should phrase it differently. What a pain it is being a nice person. Fucking curse. Can’t tell people half the things I want to say.
	Going to see Jeffy tomorrow in Cohasset. Evan is in Fla. The cats are alternately infuriating and enchanting. Sometimes both at once. I love math. Why do people hate math? It always works. Always. Always always always. Isn’t that great? Admit it.
	See DO THE RIGHT THING.
	You are wonderful. I am addicted to writing you. You’ve ruined me for other people. I can’t write to other people any more, it’s too frustrating. That’s not good, there’s nowhere for us to go. I need to go someplace far away. I need to write to someone who will go with me. Who? Maybe Francois. Nice name. You had your chance. I sneeze about sex, too. Sex and love. No difference. Shouldn’t be, anyway.
Love and Love and Love …	   Brian
2:40 am

I didn’t send this letter to you until a few months later.
Getting mugged outside of Sue and Gina’s apartment was a very strange, unhappy experience, and made me start thinking about leaving Boston. My life was seriously weird at this point.


 
July 10, 1989 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
	Lying on the living room floor last night in the dark I told Kira and Paul, a new friend, that I felt very communal. Kira corrected my pronunciation. I think we were both right.
	I said that because I have been spending so much time with people lately. Just got back from a weekend in Michigan on the lake, with six other people, none of whom I’ve known longer than 2 months. Kira didn’t even go. It was pretty excellent. These people are really mellow and friendly, and I’ve been hanging out with them pretty much lately. It is so easy being with people. Everything just flows along. But again, the need for the contrast of aloneness.
	I took a hell of a lot of pictures. I’m psyched about that. I went to a pro-choice demonstration last week and took pictures there. Just got them back. I want to be able to do it myself (develop). (That damn money thing it fucking sucks.) My interview – yes, I have one – with the magazine of my choice is coming up. I want it. I know what I can do. Soon they will know.
	What else am I doing? Thinking ahead, imagining myself traveling in a year, living other places. Imagining myself in grad school in a year. Possible worlds. Went out dancing the other night at a new club. Felt like I looked like a grad student. No make up, no cleavage, no big hair.
	I wish I didn’t have this stinking cold. Went swimming during the days, skinny dipping at night in the lake, stayed up ‘til all hours. No wonder it’s hanging on like a little beast. Then I drink coffee up the wazoo. My idea of taking care of my cold is to drink orange juice with my seven cups of coffee… really…
	Yesterday lying on the beach in the afternoon I had a moment of euphoria when I suddenly felt very connected. So much so that I even heard the clunk of being connected. Pretty fucking cool. So on a grand scale, I don’t worry. This pen sucks.
7-13 Things happen and happen. Listen to this, man, I’m right where I’m at, right where I want to be and ain’t that fucking way the hell cool?? I got what I wanted, got what I came here for – had an interview with the Metro Magazine and kicked butt. Walked out with what I set out to get, which was a chance to write, edit, think, and learn everything I possibly can about this business. My interview, which turned into breakfast too, was with Stan Malinowski, the 50 year old fashion photographer who started the magazine. He opens doors for women and walks on the street side and pays the bills. He’s also in the middle of a lawsuit with Playboy. Anyway, he liked what I had to say and said he’d like to work with me. So now all I need to do is get a job to pay the bills. I don’t care that Metro won’t make me money. I’m just way psyched that I’ll be getting experience and be working on a product that I like and that excites me. Yeehah!! (Yes, I am exuberant in my low key Virgo way…)
	So now I am writing, getting together writing sample and brainstorming for feature ideas. It’s way cool. It is engaging. It absorbs me. This feels like an amazing time, after so much dread stillness of last winter/spring. I am thinking about – There is a young, beautiful German couple sitting across from me. Her back is to me and I can see his face as he leans forward, mesmerized by her animated words, obviously loving her, her words, her facial expressions with every ounce of his being. They kiss. They love each other. They are intimate.
	I forget what I was thinking about.
	Your tape was is amazing. Thank you. I say to Kira – I love Brian. And not just because he sends me tapes.
	You lucky dog.
	I gotta get out of here, I’m drinking way too fucking much coffee and using that fuck word way too much.
	I just found out that my Visa cash advance limit just made a quantum leap up to my total credit limit. That means I’ve got cash up the wazoo if I want it. Jesus what a life. Monopoly money. Kira constantly borrows money from me, when she’s the one who works full time… makes me laugh.
	O.K. man. I see you. Naomi called me last night, about ½ an hour after I had a premonition that she would call. When the phone didn’t ring at the moment of my premonition, I willed her to call me, imagined it happening, imagined telling Paul about it. Then it all happened. Pretty (fucking) cool.
	See you. Love you.
							♡ Lisa

I wasn’t quite sure what to make of the 50 year old fashion photographer who was suing (or being sued by?) Playboy, but I could see that you were already starting to thrive in Chicago.







 
July 29, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	I have been thinking recently that it is not “healthy” to write you the way I do, but it is Saturday and Bill has stood me up and Evan is gone and I don’t want to read or work and the temptation is pretty strong.
       Updates on my last letter:
1) Marcia and her husband, Tom, have moved to Boston. I went over last weekend. It was cool but resolved nothing.
2) I went to Sue and Gina’s. Sue was gone. I got beat up sitting out on the sidewalk.
       You called recently. I hate phone conversations with people I never see. We didn’t call back. Sorry. What was on your mind?
       I have been: writing things down when I get stoned, asking my dad to go into business with me, spending money on bad CDs, in meetings all day, afraid to go into clothing stores, sure I lost my checkbook when it was in the bag with the CDs, appreciating cats, wishing I was taking photos, home (VA) to spend hellish evenings with Missy, invited by Karen to Lenox (don’t want to go), cussed out mysteriously by Jeff on the phone today, invited by my folks to the beach (want to go, but too flabby), etc.
       Things I have decided: human hearts are too fragile for what we do to them, intelligence stopped evolution, I am dangerous with time on my hands. Not much, as you can see.
       I have a man, he follows my hips with his hands.
       Don’t worry, dance in the road and it    EXPLODES   .
love
Brian

I don’t remember Jeff cussing me out, ever.


 
August 4, 1989 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
	I got your letter. I love your letters. I don’t understand what is not healthy. As for my phone call, I was just being fucking spontaneous. I missed you even more than usual at that moment. The other night a friend of Kira’s from Brown named Brian called. She said hi, Brian, for a couple minutes I thought it might be you, you, you. But no. I know, though, sometimes phone conversations can suck… So I’ll never call you again. God, the air is filthy here and it stinks. My lungs are shriveling. Not that my smoking daily is helping them any… only at night, and only on the back porch. It becomes a ritual. I don’t know why. Kira and I hang. We spend a lot of time together which is a great thing. I love that crazy woman. There are a lot of damn good things about being here. She is one of them. Karen is coming back in a few days. I don’t know how it will be. I don’t blame you for not wanting to go to Lenox. She is way the hell distant. I don’t know how to connect with her now. Too much of her own shit to deal with. She may be staying with us a couple nights a week, or so I hear from Mary. I have yet to hear at all from Karen.
	I haven’t been alone much lately, and haven’t even wanted to. Unusual for me. But now my social phase is taking a new turn. I am beginning to feel like it is time start testing some relationships, start seeing what is really there, who I can connect with. I start to feel wary of trusting too much, or assuming too much. Isn’t it the same old fucking issue? Same old bitch. Same old wound of existence. Sometimes I put on this wrap of saying fuck it. But is always pretty transparent. I am tired of putting on wraps.
	I feel pretty indestructible. I should get some health insurance. I’m treating my body like shit. Went bowling last night and hurt my back. From fucking bowling. It’s better though. The ball was too heavy. Now my heart is pounding and I can’t quite breathe. Too much coffee. Shit. I feel like shit. Merde. Guess it all catches up. Time to start watching it, maybe…
	Maybe I’ll go back to the races win enough money to come out and visit you. I went a couple weeks ago. Lost about $10. Easy come, easy go. I’m easy. I don’t think you believe that I will ever come to visit you again.
	Oh, Bri, this desk job is stultifying my brain. Oh woe, oh lamentation. I want to be in a costume fitting instead… I remember writing to you about 2 years ago from a stupid receptionist job. I still hate it. I can feel the toxins in my body, the trapped result of this stress and stultification. I even made me think I might go running when I get home. Running.
	8-6 Way the hell stressed out at 5:00 Friday. I left work, got the el, had to get off 3 stops later when the train started burning. Couldn’t stand waiting for the next train being smashed by sweat on every side, so I started walking the 3 miles home. Cursed like a madwoman all the way home. Walking through the alley to my street still way stressed, I ran into 3 friends – Kira, Pat, Foxy. They soothed and succored me and gave me iced tea. I peeled off my nylons, hitched up my skirt, and put my feet up. Ah, weekends with friends. Gotta love ‘em. Had a great weekend hanging out. Restored my sanity. Today, Monday, I got ready for temp work and headed downtown, but then couldn’t take it. Called and said I wouldn’t be in. Went to Utrecht and bought art supplies, things I need to work on my design portfolio. I’m headed back into theater. I love it too much, despite the craziness. Visit. Sometimes I’m not good at all at dealing with reality shit, like blowing off work today. I’m so fucking poor but I’d rather know that I’m doing what is best. That attitude is going to get me in trouble. Jesus. Anyway, though, as soon as I get into some theater work I’ll be happier. I just can’t take this other shit. I’d much rather deal with crazy hours and unpredictability than this 9-5 hell. Yes, I want weekends, and I’ll do what I can to keep them. But I can only go so far… Ya know?
	Karen told me that your cats are called Bob and Jeff. That explains your crazy message. I thought it was just a bad flashback joke.
	I’m taking the GRE’s in October. What I’ll end up in school for is up for discussion. Design? Theater? I can’t believe how fucking random I am.
	I am quitting my internship. It is too random. Visit. Am I an escapist? Fuck it, I’d rather die at any moment and be able to say I was doing the right thing to the end…
	I am on the verge of getting involved or not getting involved in an emotional thing. (I’m avoiding the r-word.) Something happened with a friend here but I don’t know what will happen next. My days of falling immediately and crazily in love are past. Everyone else is guarded, so I am too. Fucking shit.
	Crazy summer. Maybe I’ll go back to Lenox for next summer? I am crazy. How long will life be this unsettled? My life. Cleaned my room last night like mad. Visit. Piles of shit everywhere for weeks, but I finally had to clear my head. Felt good. Slept well.
	So I guess I’ll see you, man. Please keep writing. I love you.
Love,
Lis

Sorry about the phone thing. It’s truly my least favorite medium for communication, but I should have been happy to talk to you.

[Stoned Letter to Lisa:]

“catch me go get back a date”
– Mexican Women

Dear Lisa,
	Took effort this time, but at least I want to write. This is unhealthy because I look at myself and think “what the fuck are you doing?” Or something like that. Had it all figured at one point. Anyway, it seems kind of skewed the degree of intimacy we/I reserve for these letters.
	Talked to two people total all day. The cleaner at work and a friend on the phone. I am definitely an emissary in this world. That is unhealthy, too, yes? It’s impossible for me to tell. I believe so, but I don’t know. Sometimes I feel like one of those children who have no perception of pain, and must be taught to guess when they are being hurt. Today I was telling myself “This must be loneliness”. But it was mixed, not all bad, like I have learned it should be. Today was actually worse than most. Sometimes I feel “lonely” and it is great.
	Need to go ungrammatic. Excellent. Must still be stoned. It itched. Tired, too. 2;12 am. Started this at 1:30 or so. That last para was hard. Have to pretend I know who is reading this. How you will be when you read it. Assume I am not wasting a good piece of paper. You do not share this doubt. But this is how I make it burn. I hope it burns. Makes you shiver to read it. Afraid to read it again. Put it away till it cools down and read it again sometime next year. Me just writing it now and you reading it and I imagine that there is no distance between us at all.
	Okay… Enough of that. Felt you in my car today on the way home from work. Where you in my car? Stay outta my car, baby. Almost thought you were there. Call us again, I dare you.

Another letter that I didn’t send until later. Again, I was concerned that I was becoming too attached to you.



 
August 28, 1989 – From Lisa
Dear Brian, 
I couldn’t get myself to do anything today. So I’m sitting in the kitchen listening to Elvis, a.c. on, shirt off, letting my mind wander. I can’t find a friggin board to use as a desk. Or a chair. Oh, I suppose I could find one. I’ve been sitting on my futon typing but it’s fucking with my lower back and I don’t want it to become chronic. At least I have the house to myself. I did manage to salvage an old dresser from the alley, so soon I’ll have somewhere besides the floor to put my clothes.
I probably already told you that I’m a working woman again. It’s going well. The show that I’m dressing is fast and fun. What more could I ask for? And the actors are sweet and I love theater. And I get to sit around the house all day and still make a living. I should be studying for the GRE’s. I will study for them. I love Elvis.
Had a bout of homesickness. Saw Margaret for a long weekend but not long enough. And I miss my mom and dad. But I have the feeling that I won’t be leaving Chicago until December, thanks to my schedule and my Visa bill. It looks like Naomi might be moving here and moving in with us. Kim is moving to California in October. Naomi is not happy in Boston, living with Chip. I gave her your number. She’s kinda lonely. I would be way psyched to live with her. I am crossing my fingers.
So this solitude thing. I am alone more now. I like it, but I still feel unsettled with it, which is odd. Not sure what the hell is going on. I don’t feel like I’m doing enough with my solitude. Is that funky? Too many people are too far away. When I am not with someone here I am writing to someone who is far away. Now I am listening to the tape you made me. When there’s an empty moment won’t you dedicate it to me.
9 1  It’s true. You get what you need. The other night around midnight I stepped out onto the back porch and looked out over the alley. Two chairs hung over the edge of the dumpster caught my eye. Kira and I put on clothes and shoes and went down to check them out. Came back up with a chair, a huge wood dining room table, and a small desk that is also a fold-out sewing machine. It made us laugh. So now I’m set. I got what I needed. Now I’m in the process of preparing the dresser for repainting. It makes me happy. And it should make my back happy, having a desk to type at, but I think it might take a while for it to heal, as today it hurt like a bitch. I don’t want to be old and rickety. 
The latest news is that Naomi is moving here in October, and today I am happy to be alone. And I still need a haircut.


9 5 89 
Dear Brian,
New day, new feeling, new letter. There is a beautiful picture of you on the wall above my desk, taken with your lens by me on the green. Some day long ago, but really only a year or so. reunions.
I am still listening to Elvis. And I’m still homesick although two things happened to alleviate my sadness. I went to Joliet and I talked to my brother. Spent the night at Mary’s last night and got to be a part of her family for a night, which made me miss my own a little less, then called my brother tonight to wish him a happy birthday. He is coming to visit in October sometime, which makes me happy. What made me sad was that it sounded like his birthday had just come and gone pretty uneventfully. It made me wish that I had been there.
I have this vague feeling that I am rambling to you. Maybe because I’m not sure what’s up with you right now. I don’t like this vague feeling. What’s up, man? Talk to me. I wish we could hang for a while. I miss you.
A friend from Lenox just called. She’ll be here Thursday morning, on her way (by bus) from Northampton to San Francisco, to hang for a couple days. Her name is Carol. I don’t remember if you met her but she is way cool. I’m psyched to see her again. I think I must have been doing something right lately…
My dresser is nearly finished. All that’s left is to put handler on the drawers. Repainting it has given me immeasurable pleasure, as did having a weekend alone in the house. Kira was at her grandmother’s and Kim just wasn’t around much at all, so I reveled in my solitude and listened to good music all weekend. I feel so much more whole.
I took a sudden and surprising vow of celibacy today. During the show tonight it occurred to me that it would probably be quite a while before I got at all involved with someone or had any entanglements. Maybe a vow is too strong a word. Maybe I think I’ll just be more cautious. Not that I’ve been a madwoman anyway… But hell.
I think I need to sleep. I’m being interviewed tomorrow morning by a guy from the Trib who wants to write about dressing this show. Guess that means this is the big time. ha. See you, man.
Love,
Lis

I’m curious about the photo of me on the green. I don’t remember it at all.


 
September 15, 1989 – From Brian
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RIGHT?
Dear Lisa,
	Here is what is up with me. I am almost out of the marijuana that I bought from Peter this summer, so I tried to roll a small joint. I didn’t want to get too high anyway. It is impossible to predict my tolerance these days. After about 10 drags, I went to the john and took a shower that I didn’t need. Came back and laid down on the bed, thinking that I should write what I was thinking instead of just lying there, but this was a thought that I had had and ignored before. I turned on the fan and turned out the light. I put my head near the radio and pointed my feet at the fan, sideways on the bed, and felt myself air-drying for a while. I listened to the DJ and wondered what he thought about what he was playing. It was format radio, so I doubt he had a lot of choice in the matter, but I was interested anyway. I pictured myself running a station where the DJs said what they thought about the music. There was a playlist, because we had to make ratings in order to get bigger, but I pictured that the DJs just told the truth about the whole thing anyway. I imagined a groundswell of support for the idea.
       I thought of a story based around a character who was the exact opposite of an average American. Who hated revenge and found house pets to be an alien idea. Who would not get in a car or watch TV. Who talked to people walking by on the street and frequently cheated shopkeepers who trusted him out of money. Such a person would be totally inhuman and also defined by humanity. He would wrestle with the same problems we do, but from the other side. I pictured him not as the man in the mirror, but as the man in the floor, standing upside-down with his feet against ours. I pictured walking on a mirrored floor and imagining this man under me, moving with me, the warmth of his soles through the floor against mine.
       I thought about being high, and all the people who are against it. It is Saturday and I wondered about myself home alone. I know that Peter would not approve. Nor did he like my job or how I organized my life around it. I imagined us living together once he gets out of school. Wondered whether we could keep each other balanced like we used to, or whether we had already given in to our opposite temptations. I pictured him coughing from smoking pot too much and hoped that I could shape my concern in a way that would respect his sovereignty. Wondered if that was what you were supposed to do; it seemed right to me.
       Thought about making love to a woman I know as the girlfriend of a friend of a friend. Wondered how I always managed to be into people’s girlfriends. Pictured her skin against mine. Wondered about the texture of its blackness. Remembered touching her the last time we saw each other, at a long wedding reception where we talked on and off the whole day. Remembered her becoming real to me through the things she said that day, though I had known her for a long time. Pictured her back arched away from me, touching me at the belly, feeling her roll back onto me. Her breasts against my hands, my fingers splayed slightly around them. Wondered about having breasts. What it was like to receive pleasure through one’s breasts.
       It had been awhile. The DJ was talking again. It sounded terrible and I imagined going downstairs to listen on the stereo. It seemed terribly far away, but I did not want to go to sleep. I got up to go, putting on jeans and a t-shirt. Thought about looking stoned and rumpled when Evan got home. Thought about things waiting to get done, how I had postponed them during the week till the weekend where I found myself high once again. Arrived downstairs and spotted the empty paper from a couple days ago when I got stoned but found myself not wanting to write you. Thought of how sick I was of writing you letters. Regretted yet another correspondence to a woman I never see. Thought about us both trusting the people in our lives. Comparing notes on how much trust they could take before they snapped. Wondered why did not simply trust each other. Thought of the thinness of the barrier between us. Felt you clawing away at it from your letters. Saw it removed and me falling through and into you and through you. Hoped we were not hurt by the collision. Sat down to write.
love,
Brian

This is one of my favorite letters to you and certainly the best thing I ever wrote while stoned. I was listening to a tinny little clock-radio. I still remember the woman I mentioned, but I’m not certain of her name and I don’t know what happened to her. I felt a real connection to her that day, but she was strictly off-limits.




 
September 25, 1989 – From Lisa
Dear Brian, 
Your letter knocked me over. It hasn’t been the first time. 
I am listening to 37.2 Le Matin, otherwise known as Betty Blue. The other day I was blue but I got over it by going out dancing. The blueness struck randomly and it hurt but dully. After a while it pissed me off. I did some drawing which removed me from the whole thing. More drawing.
Today I have no voice. My brain feels like it has a crease in it, going in the wrong direction. I am hoping to be well soon. Maybe the sickness accounts for my lethargy. It sucks to be sick on my one day off. But I’ve been sick for days.
So Brian, why don’t you come out here and visit? I hate it that you are sick of writing letters. Since when do you never see me, and does this have to do with me moving out here or is it a change in perspective? I would like to know. The other thing is that I am going to be writing to you for as long as I live and as long as we are not in the same place unless you tell me not to. (Although I honestly don’t know if I could stop.) So if you’re not into writing, and I can understand why, then don’t for a while. I won’t let go. I value our correspondence and our friendship more than most things in this world. I am tenacious. You lucky son of a bitch.
Happy birthday, man. I thought of you. I had a good birthday myself, spoke to or heard from people I love. I’m happy to be this old. More shit comes together every year, even though at times I feel like I’m standing still or floundering.
Summer is over. I’m trying to let it go. Most of the time I’m psyched for fall and a new phase of life but I can’t help an occasional pang. I’m trying to understand how everything can feel so stable these days when I still get funky, I still get pissed at things, still those swings. Under it all though a feeling of general calm, which worries me a little, makes me suspect that I’m in for something soon. But maybe I should be counting my blessings and taking advantage. More drawing, maybe. My feet are cold. Shit.
Once in a while I’ve tried writing while in an altered state. The things that come out seem to be more bare and more painful. Maybe. I liked your letter. I miss your ticking.
Please send wool socks. I love you.
Love,
Lis

I was sick of writing you letters because it felt like I was pouring my heart into yet another unattainable relationship. I worried that my feelings for you might spin out of control if we continued this way.
 
September 30, 1989
Dear Lisa,
	It is my intent to knock you over. I have this image of my letters burning fingers. You can only read one once, immediately after receiving it. You read the whole thing in a minute, skipping words in a rush to get to the end. Then it gets put away in a drawer, but you are aware of it every time you come near. Maybe a year later you taking it out and it is dense and cold as you read, when before it was fire.
	It only recently occurred to me that this is a rather one-sided way to write. I was re-reading our correspondence and I noticed that there were all these events in your life that I had completely overlooked in my replies. Sometimes I even explicitly expressed uninterest or treated lightly something you had carefully communicated. When I get your letters, I always scan for the part where you say what you thought of my last letter. This is pretty reprehensible, and I apologize.
	I would very much like to come visit you. Perhaps the beginning of November?
	I never see you, literally. Rarely even when you lived out here. No change in perspective; I’m not even sure what you mean by this. And it’s not just writing that bugs me, but the whole pattern of our knowing each other. There are aspects of it which are very familiar to me from previous train wrecks I have been in. I could very easily be in love with you, I suppose you know. Sometimes I think I am and wish I wasn’t. Sometimes I think I’m not and wonder why the fuck not. That the issue arises at all is a sign of my hilarious predictability. I probably haven’t written a letter to a man in two years.
	Saw Sue tonight for the first time in a year and a half. It is pretty sad the damage we did to each other. I used to worry that I was only imagining that I could touch her heart. But now it is pretty clear that I mistook her sheer fragility for distance and blew her to pieces with my good intentions. At least I don’t come home confused any more.
	I value our correspondence, too, as I’m sure you know, though I have a problem with any promise that ends with “for the rest of my life.” You can take comfort in the fact that the urge to write you dwarfs the knowledge that I shouldn’t when it comes. To be honest, there is nothing creatively or emotionally equal in my life. Congratulations. My parents are coming next month, would it be OK if they read our letters? I think they are very curious about my life.
love
Brian

The first paragraph of this letter is just too cheesy. Ugh. The rest is pretty good. I was able to be honest about my feelings.
This is also when I sent you some of the earlier letters that I had been holding onto.


 
October 16, 1989 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
	The other night I took a candlelit bath with Gabriel Yared. Actually with his music. Betty Blue. It was amazing, but then the water started slowly draining out and I had to go to work. For a few minutes, though, it was extremely pleasurable.
	Today I helped a friend strike the lights from the show we worked on together, which just closed. We worked, talked, listened to music for about 4 hours. He offered to drive me home so I wouldn’t have to walk in the rain. I opened the door to the alley and was shocked by the darkness. So the outside world does go on. I think that doing theater makes me an escapist. Or being an escapist makes me do theater. Which?
	I got your letters and loved them. I’ve been carrying them around with me. No matter what you say, you are a great writer.
	I’m almost out of candles, the only thing that’s going to get me through this hellish winter. There is a fucking gale that comes under our back door. You can practically see into the apartments across the alley though the cracks around our door. Jesus.
	Sometimes I am terribly distracted. I’m sure I would be less so if I lived alone, but that’s not really what I want. I love living with Kira, who is, by the way, pretty psyched that you’re coming to visit. She wondered if you might bring some pot with you. I think I mentioned, or Kira mentioned, to Karen that you were coming. Karen said she called you when she was in Lenox and she didn’t hear from you. She asks me, Does Brian hate me? I haven’t seen much of her here and am sometimes apprehensive about seeing her, for reasons I don’t feel like figuring out right now. Sometimes I wonder with her, do things really have to be that complicated? Man am I psyched to see you or what.
	Things that have made me cry lately: Mark Knopfler. Joan. Thinking about my family. Thinking about people who are far away.
	Still I feel guarded. Too many people are too much of a disappointment for me not to be guarded. But at least I feel like I’m coming out of this goddamn calm, this emotional mediocrity that has been plaguing me lately. I suppose it takes emotional vulnerability to avoid mediocrity. So when it comes down to it, I’m still willing to take the risk of getting slammed, for all my talk about my growing cynicism and toughness. I’m still not too tough to chew on.
	My fingertips, on the other hand, are like hardened wax. My guitar is one of my closest friends these days.
	I just ate too much ice cream but it keeps me well-padded.
	Math always works but you never get slammed so where’s the challenge? It’s just too safe.
	I don’t quite understand what is going now with Sue but I hope it isn’t too much hell. As Susan Ceci once said, “No man is worth it.” And I’m sure that applies to women too.
	So maybe I’ll call you (god forbid) one of these days so we can make plans. A friend is going to be here during the first week of November but after that is good. I’m looking at my calendar now and realizing I’ll probably going home around the 19th or so; what about the weekend before that?
	It would be fine for your parents to read our letters. I would be interested to know what they think. I don’t suppose we’d give them any more grey hairs.
	I love you. I think of you. Maybe I was in your car.
								Love, Lis

I don’t really remember much of what was going on during this period with Karen. I guess it was just more of the same problem?




 
November 2, 1989 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
1) You owe me a phone call. Chick. How are we going to do this? I need to make plans with my folks for Thanksgiving, too. Tell Kira I only have about one joint’s worth, but I will try to save it.
2) It occurred to me today while watching TV how unprepared I am to live outside this society and how unwilling I am to live in it. I can see it in my parents, sometimes, the guilt they feel over the world they raised me into and the degree to which they helped corrupt my ability to break free. I am slaved to TV and red meat and no exercise and “efficiency” and cars and my own sex drive, which is used to sell me beer. I would not know how to escape without crumbling every familiar idea.
3) I had this image of the truth as a bright light, and me standing in front of it. And trying to stop denying the truth, and each recognized truth pokes a hole in my body, until I am swiss cheese and then finally transparent.

Just a bit of junk that barely even makes sense. I never finished it or sent it.

 
November 25, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	Well, this is impossible. I am in the folks’ house in VA. No cigarettes or decent paper to write on. No comfortable place to write without fear of interruption. Just coming out of brainless vacation-mindset of playing cards and eating and reading the paper. Fun, but it gets me far away from myself if I don’t make the effort to secure privacy and become centered. Full of things to say to you all weekend, but the thought of writing was alien (because of my mindset, that is). Frustrating. I love documenting my life in letters to you. Wish I could record every moment for a time in the future when I could make sense of it. Being home has produced this incredible wave of nostalgia (I guess it’s nostalgia, I’ve never been old enough to experience it before) for high school. At the time I was 15 or 16 and absolutely clueless. I convinced myself that everyone in the school was conservative idiots (mostly true), and used this as an excuse to know no one there. There were all these cool people and situations, now that I look back on it. Dug out my senior yearbook and read all these notes from people I never saw again. It’s surprising how well they knew me, I knew them not at all (in any real way). Maybe because they were all a year or two older than me, I don’t know. Anyway, now I just feel this weight of missed opportunities and the time which has separated me from the people who seemed to care about me without any reciprocation. Saw that this one chick had just gotten married, we were friends in school, but I made no effort to keep in touch with and now I’m jealous. Felt like calling some of them up, even though I have probably disappeared from their minds. There was this girl in my science class who was so great but incapable of science and she was my lab partner. I ragged on her mercilessly, and we sat around and talked about poetry and I cruised through the work while she struggled so hard without thinking of giving up. And now it is somehow crystal clear to me how insecure and hurt she was by my treatment, which was pure ignorance of my part. She was one of us, I know it. I’m sure she would be my best friend now if only I had a clue about her then. Her name is Donna Coffey. Her number is still in the phonebook, I checked. I know I am having exaggerated feelings, but it is so strong, the desire to go back and fix things that happened seven years ago. Is that what the time delay on understanding your life is – seven years? That means I have to wait until 1994 before Brown starts to make sense. I wish I was like Karen who writes down everything, including her dreams. Which is like recording the pure stuff, like cheating, it’s so great.
	I would really like to come visit you over Christmas. We should make plans soon. Are you going to have any time to hang out? Not that we have to spend the whole time together, but it would be a shame for you to come home from work and not have the energy to be with me fully. Your call. Are Kira and Karen going to be around then? I hope so. Tell Kira I will bring her herb if I get some (I’m working on it now). I miss Karen. Do you have her address, phone #, etc?
	Well, there are all these things, but I don’t think they’re worth tackling now, my eloquence level seems pretty low. I got this great letter from Sue. It’s the saddest letter ever. Evan even got sad when he read it. Great stuff and I really want to copy it into a letter to you with the whole story. Maybe later. I miss you so much. I think about you every day and it is very sweet and very strong.
love,
Brian


I’ve been able to reconnect with several of my high school friends since we moved back to DC. I’ve totally forgotten whatever guilty feelings I had about Donna Coffey, and I have no idea what happened to her after high school.



 
November 28, 1989 – From Brian
Tuesday
Dear Lisa,
	I bought the new Richard Bach paperback, One, in the airport on the way back from VA with Evan. Truly a book that deserves to be bought in airports. I just finished it, and let me tell you what sort of facile New Age crap it is. I’m sorry, the guy has just lost it. And worst of all, he ruins the entire topic for those who believe there is something more, but admit that no one knows much about it.
	You know, I’ve probably been listening to too much punk recently, but one major fact has started to become clear to me: Most people are not only very stupid, but also incompetent at what they do. Any philosophy which does not take this into account is not going to get very far. Of which the flip side is this: The key to judging an idea or a work or a person is to look for QUALITY; not good intentions, or understandability or charm or vulnerability or any of it. I have taken this way of thinking to heart, though it is not mine originally. Seems like the only down-side is the risk of becoming closed to ideas which are difficult to appreciate. But certainly this is true of any fixed way of thinking, and even seems to be a biologically guaranteed byproduct of emotional maturity. ‘Course there’s always the fact that most of the time I have no idea what does or doesn’t have quality, but I am just starting down this path. That’s the thing: I have to work so hard just to achieve a fraction of the state of mind that is my goal that I feel really sill and awkward about it. But then when I compare myself to humanity in general, it is hard to deny that [I?] have something that is very very rare.
	All of which sounds pretty arrogant, I’m sure, but who gives a fuck. My mom’s therapist has decided that I’m arrogant, though we’ve never met. My mom quotes her as saying, “he’s just got to be” based on what she knows of me. But I say that ideas deserve the full weight of argument we can give them and total abandonment when they have fallen apart. None of this half-assed insecure shit. I’m not really sure what my value as a person is, but I tend to believe that it is pretty unrelated to the value of any particular ideas I espouse on any particular day. Most people make no such distinction, I think. So I appear arrogant and inconsistent. Still we talked about this at home and the general consensus seems to be that, yes, I am quite arrogant. Which breaks my heart since it is not what I want to be, but what else can I do?
	It is work that is doing this to me. Half the people I work with are incompetent, and this is one of the few areas where I am good enough that such incompetence is glaringly obvious. Fucking dicks. Just trying to make a living, though. Perhaps it is my fault for expecting too much from people and caring too much about our project. And if that isn’t the theme of our last two years of correspondence, I don’t know what is, my love.
	Here’s the thing about Sue, as short as I can make it. One day I saw an ad for Suzanne Vega in concert. Sue is the only person around who loves S.V. like I do. I had not seen her (Sue) in a year and a half. I wrote her a letter inviting her to the concert. I purchased two tickets. She called to decline the invitation, but wanted to get together to talk. We talked; she was a wreck and I was very intense. The tickets arrived in the mail. I wrote her again saying: come to the concert, it will be fun, I know you love S.V. This is what she wrote back:
October 16, 1989
Dear Brian,
	Thanks for re-extending the invitation to Suzanne Vega, but I can’t join you. I don’t think we can just get together and have fun independent of the past and present status of our relationship, and now that we’ve actually spent time discussing how much we’ve always been at cross purposes, to get together for a concert would feel, and be, I think, irresponsible. I care too much about you and about myself to get together to use concert tickets and to try to have fun without thinking beyond that. Beyond that lies what we’ve discussed – that at this point in our lives our relationship is, because it cannot be worked out satisfactorily to both of us, at a dead end. I feel like I just need to live with that.
Sue
This woman is my soul-mate, I swear. What a waste of space. Kind of sad.
love
Brian
P.S. Doesn’t it bother you that it is purely libido that drives me to write like this to you at 2:00 am like it is the only thing in the world I can even think of doing?

Yikes, this is just ugly. Did I really write this? Blech.
I have no idea why I made such a big deal about that letter from Sue, or what exactly my point was, even. Copying her letter word-for-word probably just helped me process and accept that our relationship was utterly ruined and there was nothing I could do about it.






 
December 4, 1989 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
Your letter was worth more than 45¢. I just sat on the floor and read it. Jesus, I’m tired of not being able to talk, as much as I love our correspondence.
Maybe it’s because I’ve been on drugs (advil) or maybe because I’m trying to ward off insanity, but I’ve been in a fucking slippery daze lately. My emotions just go sliding around amorphously like jello, not really absorbing much impact. Every once in a while I’ll feel a purge of pretty fucking happiness and then it’s all over like a half-assed orgasm. It leaves me cold.
How many walls do I have to butt my head against?
I wrote a poem last night in the dark. Kira is talking about reading in the open mike at the Green Mill next sunday. We went last night to the poetry slam and heard a couple friends read and drank some wine. I am thinking about reading but I am not talking about it. Maybe, I think, I need a more public medium. Maybe I need to get up on a stage and say listen. Sometimes I feel poisoned by my own reticence. At least I don’t worry that I have nothing to say. It concerned me that the ratio of men to women reading their work was about ten to one. Guess I’ll have to do something about that. 
So when and how did you reconcile your differences with Karen? I don’t have her address but her phone number is 312 489 1184. Did I give you that already in my half-sleeping stupor? I don’t know. I don’t see her much, especially alone. Tim is always by her side it seems. It also seems that they are coming over here for Christmas although Naomi said that to me and we both thought the other must have invited them. Maybe it was Tim’s idea. Maybe we’ll cook a turkey. I want to talk to Karen. I don’t really know her life very well any more.
I’ve been pretty difficult to know lately. Had a long talk with Naomi last week, who told me to quit feeling like I had to be a solid rock of stability for her and everyone else. Which is I guess what I’d been doing. I don’t even think of myself as stable but everyone else does. So since our talk I’ve been crying more. Sometimes I feel so weak and fragile. Lonely as hell. Sue’s letter made me sad too. As did what you wrote about that woman from your science class. Too much waste with no choice but to keep looking dead ahead.
I just bought a shitload of candles. My room approaches She’s gotta have it but I am still the dateless wonder.
How do you deal with the pain of a wasted connection? Mine is the infantile ostrich method of pretended ignorance of its existence. And an occasional muttered hot breath of fuck you I hate your fucking guts as I cross the street. The infantile cursing method. Oh hell.
My other question is how can your family call you arrogant when you are so plainly dear? huh? It is true. People are incompetent and stupid in many realms of life.
12-9 So, man. I’ll be seeing you in a mere 2 weeks. Yeehah! I hope you’ll at least get to see Kira for an evening or something. She thinks you’re pretty groovy.
Everything is as unstable as hell, but it feels good. You know I hate stagnation. I can’t wait to really talk to you.
See you man.
Love,
Lis

The hints here about Kira were not lost on me.


 
December 16, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	mmm, I haven’t reconciled with Karen or talked to her or anything. I just miss her and it has occurred to me that I probably confused her as much as she confused me. Not that I don’t think she deserved it… Not that I think I didn’t, either.
	Flight info:
December 23

Chicago/O’Hare
	Wasted connections, I have no idea. The screw me up, too. It only recently dawned on me that someone could honestly feel a connection, yet not consider it very important. Guess they’ve got better things to do or something. God knows what.
	My family probably considers me plainly dear, too, they just don’t like it that I am a dick sometimes, which doesn’t bother me, depending on the circumstances of course.
	It snowed here last night and it was excellent. I was coming home, but the lines of our parking spots were covered in snow. So I got out of the car and brushed the snow away, and there they were underneath. Just where they always are. That’s what I love about reality. Some people say that there is not reality or that everyone’s is different. I know that there is exactly one reality, because it is so much more consistent and sophisticated than my fevered little imagination could ever create. That’s why it’s so great hanging our with Peter. He enjoys playing with reality even more than I do. What a great toy.
	See you soon.
love
Brian

Fortunately, I did eventually realize that no, it’s definitely not OK to be a dick. I’m not sure why I was trying to justify it here again.


 
1990
February 9, 1990 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
	Hey. It has been many weeks and I have not heard from you, so I have surmised that you are unhappy with me. I had decided to wait you out, correspondence-wise, but for some reason broke all of the sudden. Evan is sitting at his desk, and I think he is writing you a letter, too. It is 1:46 am Sunday night. This is how we live. We sit at our respective desks late at night writing letters and we talk back and forth across the hallway and the cats run amok in our rooms. Anyway, I know you disagree, but I firmly believe that sometimes one person owes another person a letter. Or a phone call or whatever currency it is that they exchange. It is a test, bluntly. So I have been thinking recently that it is on you to write me a letter, for a variety of reasons. Mainly because I have written so much more than you in the last couple of months. But also, ulteriorly, because I wanted to see what you would say about my visit without prompting from me. Whether you would express anger or not basically.
	I’m not sure why, but we certainly did seem fed up with each other by the time I left. Partly, I’m sure, because of the amount of time we spent together, especially in contrast to the amount of time we have spent together in the past. But more, I think, because of the shock of the uncompromising way in which we disagree about some basic things. Of course, I can only speak for myself in this, but it seemed that you felt the same way.
	To be honest, I relish this sort of conflict, in a way that I would guess you surely don’t. I can tell by the tone of what comes out [of] the pen that I paint this conflict in the starkest way I can, proudly. Partially, I think, to provoke you, if possible. I am not sure you are someone who responds to provocation, and, well, I guess I’m just curious. Plus I enjoy the fact that at the same time I am admitting it, I am doing it. Aren’t I fucking clever? I suppose the risk I run is that all I will succeed in doing is to piss you off completely. Which is honestly not my intention nor my desire. Are you totally pissed off by now? Probably. Sorry. It’s pretty funny – I seem to have written myself into a corner here.
	But here is the main reason I enjoy this conflict. Because it shows me so clearly that there are two distinct levels in this, and everything else really. We can disagree deeply about things like astrology and mysticism and whether someone is a visionary or an idiot for thinking that he dreamt his wife before he met her. While I may seem sure of my thoughts about these things, you can rest assured that I am not. And that it is the reason I suddenly decided to write this – to tell you that on the deeper level that I just remembered how tied to you I am, that my heart is with you timelessly because it has been with you once. Even if you do owe me a letter.
love
Brian
upon questioning, I will disavow any knowledge of this letter –––––––––––––––
Well, this is no good and I’m glad I didn’t send it. I was trying to reconcile my idealized image of you with the imperfect reality of my visit to Chicago, but this was a lousy way to do it.




 
February 9, 1990 – From Lisa
Dearest Brian, 
It’s been way long. I miss you. My room is a lovely mess and I’m alone in the house, and I’m unemployed. Surprised? I’ve known for weeks that our show was closing but today is really the first day I’ve done anything about getting a job, except for one interview a couple weeks ago that led to zero. I think I’m just too good at unemployment. I am so fucking happy when I’m not working. Not exclusively then, but especially. It’s been only a few days and the time to myself has done wonders. The end of my job marks the end of a larger phase and the beginning of what I sense will be a better one. I am reawakening the creative forces that have been pretty damn lazy for too damn long. Started drawing again. I was pretty sucky at first but am getting better with each drawing. And my guitar is finally in the shop after about two months of illness, thanks to inertia on my part. And I’ve got the writing urge back. All of this may not sound terribly momentous, but considering the state I’ve been in for the last couple months it feels like a turning point. I suppose the main focus of this last phase could be summed up in one word: hanging. I’ve been terribly social and lazy and pleasure-seeking, along with Naomi and Tony and Steve, a friend of Tony’s with whom – get this – I’ve started getting involved. I know, it’s hard to believe. The spinster cracks. We’re still in the very beginning of things, and I still have that little bit of sheer terror, that feeling that there’s no way in hell that I could have it so good. But the truth is that he’s a great guy, we get along splendidly, and he’s not a bit of an asshole. Something new... so when I’m not scared I’m pretty happy. (o.k., so that was an understatement.) Anyway, the four of us had been spending an awful lot of time together, hanging out at Bento’s, Manny’s, here. It was always a hilarious time but the dynamics could be limiting. So we’re starting to spend more time apart from each other, which is a good thing. Meanwhile I had seen almost nothing of Kira until this week when I had evenings at home. It was distressing me that we never had time together, so this down time has had another good effect. I hate drifting. This time has also allowed me to think about what to do next, in the sort of grand scheme. As usual, I really have no idea, but the thought of grad school has come back to haunt me. Will I ever make up my mind? I know, at least, that I don’t want to study theater, and I do want to write, so that’s a start. I’ll most likely get another job in theater for now so that I’ll still have my days free to work on my own thing . That’s as specific a plan I can come up with now… At least I am aware of my faults, even if I don’t know quite how to correct them.
My guitar is back. Now I suck again, but I know it’s like the drawing. Guess I’ll be playing a lot. It’s Friday night. Kira is out on a date with this guy she’s been crushing on for quite a while. He asked her out. Naomi is at work. Tony and Steve are in Minneapolis and I have no plans but to eat pasta, write, draw, read, and play guitar. Every once in a while, my life is truly glorious. I bought another book today. I have gotten to be an addict. I must have been in about seven bookstores in the last three days. I gravitate toward them and I almost always come out with one more book to my name. These days I’m reading a Marquez book called In Evil Hour. So far it doesn’t quite measure up to One Hundred Years, but I like it. Before that I read a couple Hemingway books in a row and started on a third but found I needed to switch to something else first. Kira was reading David Lipsky’s book of short stories not long ago and her reaction was to roll her eyes and say, “It’s all about Brown!” And to point out that her copy was a library book and she would never pay for such a thing. I haven’t read any of it.
2 11 I saw Tahir again. I called Friday night around nine to see how his week had been and figured he was sleeping. He called me back around eleven, we talked, and he decided to get in his car and come out. So he arrived between three and four and we had an amazing weekend. It was good to feel back in touch. I feel back in touch in many ways. Man, is life ever strange… I also feel rather like I’d like to yell and sing and externalize the hell out of myself. I don’t understand why I am so reticent sometimes. In many ways it really sucks the big one. Sometimes it feels like a problem and sometimes it feels just like the way that I am. Now is one of the problem times, but at least I feel like doing something about it. It’s a matter of creative expression, having others see my creation, but also just a matter of expressing my thoughts and feelings on a daily basis. I start to wonder if other people are constantly wondering what is up with me, or if they just stop trying to know. That would make me sad.
We saw the movie Always last night, which I think was inspired by a lot of the writings of Richard Bach. About union and love and spiritual inspiration. In addition to making me shed a quart of tears it made me think about my approach to relationships, my goddamn caution. Acting, or not acting, out of fear, or tempering feelings with fear, can never be a positive force. So I’m gonna try and stop that nonsense. It also made me think about loss. I haven’t had to deal with loss through death yet, and I don’t know how good I’ll be at it. The worst thought for me is the idea that someone I love could go away without knowing that they could take a part of me with them, that I would want them to, and that I would always keep a part of them with me. And even knowing that about certain people, I still fear the daily loss. I suppose I also fear that my reticence will leave too many things unsaid for too long. So I’ve got some shit to work on…
Still working on dream lucidity. It is such a difficult process, but I’m sure my efforts are paying off, and meanwhile I’m remembering a lot of pretty fascinating dreams. A couple too many that were frightening and evil, but small wonder considering the things I’ve just been talking about. Anyway, Bri, I miss you and I love you, and it makes me happy writing to you. Tell me how you are.
Love,
Lis
Please tell Evan hi and I am writing him.

This was a much better letter than the one I wrote at the same time and decided not to send.


 
February 25, 1990 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	Actually, I wrote you a letter at about the same time you wrote me, but it was perverse and kind of aggressive and I’m glad that I didn’t send it. Especially when your letter came the next day – the contrast was sobering.
	It was good to visit you. I swear, though, it take me months to sort through events, even the simple and gentle ones. I can still picture you, me, and Naomi sitting in a booth, and I’m handing out career advice like I’m Donald Trump and you two becoming more and more depressed. Strange scene; I apologize if I gave the impression that I had any idea what I was talking about.
	I didn’t send our correspondence to my folks, so I still owe them a Christmas present. They sent me luggage and books, but it’s not worth explaining. To be honest, I’m considerably less proud of our letters now than I was a few months ago. I’m not sure why. Maybe once I sort out some of the things that happened I will have more things to say, but for now, I think this is it.
love
Brian

During this period, I often wanted to write you, but was trying not to get so carried away. This resulted in many short letters or ones that I didn’t send at all.
 
March 3, 1990 – From Lisa
Dear Brian,
I’m not quite sure what it is you’re sorting through and I’m curious about the aggressive and perverse version, and I’m not particularly proud of my letters, I just have things to say to you. What I’m really proud of is my typing. I have to say that sometime you baffle me. You managed to puzzle me, crack me up, and give me that what the fuck feeling all within the bounds of three paragraphs. Nice going. My acerbic tone, for which I will apologize only once, stems from the last few weeks of being slowly but steadily dicked over, by the guy I believe I said was not a bit of an asshole. I was wrong. I should have clung to that sheer terror like it was my sole salvation, the only thing I could trust. It was too good to be true. He’s being an asshole, the asshole by avoidance for no fathomable reason variety. And christ, am I bitter. I’ve had it up to here with men. Here. Trust feels more like an open sore than anything else right now. But I take it like a fucking Stoic, with rare lapses of self-pity and weeping.
There’s more to my life, though, thank god. I’m working on a story. I’m finally letting something come out before I kill it with self-criticism. I’m taking a fiction workshop that is helping me get out of this block that I feel like I’ve been in forever. I was a little scared to do it but I need to do more things that scare me. Scare myself out of my complacent skin.
I am sorry. Bri, that this bitterness I feel is seeping into my words. Sorry. Now that’s twice I’ve apologized. It’s just that damn it all, it sucks to be dinged. At least I don’t take it personally. Hell, he must be blind or stupid.
I wish there were more time that we could hang out together. Maybe then there’d be less sorting to do. I think that sometimes because I feel so vulnerable and because I care so much I stumble over my own feelings and I don’t express myself very completely. So I’m sorry about that too. I’m working on that. I am terribly but exquisitely flawed, wouldn’t you say? Admit it.
How do you feel about being woken in the middle of the night by a phone call from a troubled friend? I tried last night in a state of misery to think of someone who wouldn’t mind listening to my 2 a.m. central standard time woes. I ended up having Mark Knopfler croon me to sleep.
Margaret is coming to visit me soon. I can’t wait. She may even bring Eugenia with her. I could use a little hilarity and hysterics in my life.
See you, Bri.
Love,
Lis

I wish that I had paid more attention to what you actually wrote here, instead of what was going on in my own mind.
 
March 8, 1990 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
	I know, you’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not on purpose, though, honestly. This letter is threatening to drive me crazy. I cannot do it justice right now: it’s late and I’m tired and I have yet to come to grips with what has been plaguing me recently. Long stares out windows, depressing situations, inability to accomplish even the smallest thing, etc. But I have to write something, it’s burning me up.
	You are one of the things that I am upset about. Not because of anything you’ve done, but because of how I find myself positioned in relation to you. Your letter made me think these things: 1) If you are mad at me, it’s OK. Don’t blame it on some dickhead who is dumping you. 2) Late night calls from you are fine, but the phone is in Evan’s room. 3) Don’t tell me about this nobody breaking your heart. I can’t deal. I don’t understand how you can love someone you barely know, but not love me. OK? I have tried to understand the distinction that society makes between friends and lovers and what sort of sexuality is appropriate and what sort isn’t, but I have failed. And yes, I feel pretty badly about it. Suck on that for awhile. I am feeling less and less strength from knowing you, and more and more the need for restraint. Sometimes I am afraid to be honest because my feelings are negative and I do not know whether you can deal with negativeness from me. You certainly seem incapable of showing it to me. Or maybe you just don’t have any, in which case I feel like an idiot. Sometimes I am afraid to be honest because I feel the need to make physical reality out of all this spiritual love we banter so freely, and I know you disagree. Sometimes I’m afraid to be honest because I am skeptical about things you find to be clearly true.
	I know that you are vulnerable, so I just want to say again that the problems here are in me, not in you. It is up to me to find happiness in this relationship, not up to you to provide it. Believe me, you are not the only person with whom this situation exists, sort of.
	Goddamn life is a stiff wind blowing in our faces, and I can see that everyone struggles. But I don’t know how to stand. What do you do with your shoulders? How do you place your feet? I didn’t even bring the right clothes, for chrissakes!
love
Brian

My messed-up feelings prevented me from being supportive, and when I tried explain that in writing, it seemed too extreme to send. I didn’t want to alienate you.


 
March 10, 1990 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
	You’re right, I’m sorry. I just feel the need to take control of my end of our relationship, though I’m not yet exactly sure why or what I need to do. I think it may simply take some time; I am not trying to be confusing.
	Your letter was excellent, though parts gave me that what-the-fuck feeling, too. If you are mad at me, it’s O.K. Don’t blame your mood on some dickhead who is dumping you. Furthermore, I find it nearly impossible to deal with your telling me how this nobody is breaking your heart. Not that I am exactly positive that I want the chance to treat you better, but god knows I would. I have tried to understand the distinction that you and most of society make between friends and lovers, but I have failed. Not just here, but elsewhere to, with disastrous results. And, yes, I feel pretty badly about it. Sometimes I wonder what gene it is that I am so clearly lacking; everyone else seems so well-adjusted to the rules.
	I have to tell you that I am feeling less strength from knowing you, and more and more the need for restraint on my part. I feel the need to stifle myself sometimes because my feelings are negative or angry, and I am not sure that you can deal with negativeness from me. Sometimes it’s because I feel the desire to make physical reality out of all the ephemeral love we share, and I know you disagree. Sometimes it’s because I am skeptical about things you find to be obviously true. And I can’t say that yet more honesty from me will solve any of these problems.
	I know that you take what I say very deeply to heart, so I am trying to be as precise as I can with these words, though the ideas behind them are still only half-formed. I want to make it very clear, however, that the problems here are mine, not yours. It is up to me to find happiness in this relationship, not up to you to provide it.
	I have this great idea for a video/photograph installation that I want to tell you about, but maybe next letter would be more appropriate. Remind me.
love
Brian

This was a slightly gentler, saner version of the letter that I had written a few days earlier, but it was still all about me.


 
April 5, 1990 – From Lisa
Dearest Bri,
	Now I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to respond to your letter. It’s not that I haven’t been thinking about it. It’s that I have, and it’s taken a while. On top of that, my brain, body and spirit have not often been in the same place at the same time lately.
	I still am not sure what it is, Bri. I don’t know what the rules are made of for relationships. It’s be nice to say there aren’t any, but that would be bullshit. Friends and lovers? I used to think I knew right away when someone was a potential lover. Then I started finding out that people I never even thought of that way stated getting under my skin. So now I admit that there are sometimes more possibilities for crossing that line than I think. Guess that’s not much of a rule, though. In my mind, oh fuck, I don’t know what I want to say. I guess it’s that the friend/lover context of a relationship seems to be secondary to the actual relationship. To tell you the truth, though, I like the friends I have more than the lovers I’ve had. In general, friends love you just as much, and longer. Are you skeptical yet? Yes, that is one of the things I accept as irrefragable [?] truth.
	I can handle negativity. Lay it on me if you want. I’d rather that than restraint. I already know that everyone knows I’m not perfect.
	I know it’s complicated. I’m not sure what else to day. I wish I understood more. Tell me more.
	As for my heart being broken, I’m way over it. As my friend Dave says, no man is worth souring my soul over. It’s true. Susan Ceci told me that five years ago and it was true then. It will always be true. My ego is too big for me to believe overwise. Jesus Christ it’s snowing. Fuck. We’re having a party tonight. We thought it’d be spring. But a party’s a party. This might turn out to be our biggest ever.
	I’ll write again soon. This feels incomplete but I am at a loss. I love you.
Love,
Lisa

Time has shown that this was a very wise response, but it was hard for me to accept. I was tired of being the guy who is always the friend, never the lover.




 
April 15, 1990 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
	Well, I’d tell you more if there was more, but I don’t know what else to say. Maybe it’s just that I no longer believe this: “The friend/lover context of a relationship seems to be secondary to the actual relationship.” For one thing, I have simply spent too many nights by myself to take any solace in that idea any more. But what bothers me infinitely more than that is this: I don’t understand a lot about what goes into the friend vs. lover decision (I’ve never made one), but what I do understand usually turns my stomach. You can certainly fault men for always wanting to be lovers, but watching otherwise intelligent, sane, and independent women choose, time after time, to sleep with the most demeaning, backwards, sexist, hateful men they know has pretty much soured me on the whole process. I used to think that I was blessed with the ability to treat women as equals naturally. Had I known that women prefer abuse, plain and simple, I might have had a chance to change my mind. That’s why I feel so betrayed sometimes – I believe so strongly in the ideas of feminism that it kills me to see women who publicly agree but are unable or unwilling to apply the same ideas in the their own private lives. It’s so absurd, I can hardly believe it, seeing it here plainly in print, but I know it’s true. Maybe I just hang out with the wrong women. God knows I am probably bringing it on myself somehow, but I can’t see it yet. Anyway, until I make some sort of sense of it, I’m sure why you can see [sic] that I have a hard time thinking of it as “secondary”.
	Bitter, aren’t I? I have been practicing my cynicism a lot recently. Events at work have shook me to my core since that time I called you. They fired one of my best friends; escorted him from the premises. I am currently looking for another job, but am experiencing such bewilderment as I interview around. Fucking bastards, I had a great job until they screwed it up. Incompetence and hypocrisy have carried the day, as usual. Maybe I’ll be a monk.
	Sorry to seem so angry at the world. The scary part is that I know that underneath the trauma of this daily soap opera my life is a perfect void. Clean and empty. Centerless. I’m only trying to fill that void just a little with the strength of the love I feel for you and a handful of other people. It is much harder than I thought it might be though.
love
Brian

I did feel bitter at times and wrote it down to get it out of my system, but this didn’t reflect my actual views very well.


 
May 3, 1990 – From Lisa
Dear Bri.
Lately it seems that the number of people I can write to and feel like I’m getting through to is dwindling. I don’t think that’s a bad thing as long as someone is left. I miss you.
Always alone. Maybe I become more alone because I am so willing to accept solitude. Not that there haven’t been people around. Seems like I’m hardly ever physically alone, but many times I am only half there. Sometimes I am all there, and I guess it’s those times that keep me going. Same old story, same old barriers, same old desire for ultimate connection. Some things never change.
The past has been coming back to me. Talked to a couple people that I haven’t spoken with in one or two years. People I’ve been in correspondence with but haven’t had any other form of communication with. Voices out of the blue that made me happy. Almost talked to Jay yesterday but got his answering machine. Heard from my family that we had gotten an invitation to his graduate show so I called to congratulate him. Strange to hear his voice. It reminded me of why I went out with him, maybe for the sound of his voice but not for the words.
Getting back to words in more than vocabulary list form. Got through the GREs with a vague unease. Had to pee for the first half and had a wicked pain in my neck and shoulders for the second half. Fuck it. Anyway, now I have time to read and write some real stuff. It’s about the only thing that gets me going. Feels like an escape sometimes. No matter what hell I’m going through, I know that if I pick up a book of criticism my mental curiosity will get the better of my emotions every time. Sort of an automatic shut off. I’m feeling pretty mental lately.
Oh, for a time of intensity. Feels like one of those long stretches of limbo. Not as many things strike me as life or death. Not enough things strike me. Just running to catch up. Too many fucking demands. O.K. I admit it. I need more solitude. That’s it. At age twelve I wrote an essay for my application to Stone Ridge that described my picture of a perfect birthday. I wrote that I would spend the whole day alone on a beach. Weird kid. More things never change.
Remember the ending of Dangerous Liaisons where the Marquise finds out that Valmont is dead and has a fit of anguish in her dressing room? I felt like that the other day but I was walking down Halsted and had to restrain myself. Life in all its fucking glory.
How long will you be in Boston? There’s a chance I’ll be there for a couple days the first week of July. I get back from Sweden then and Kira may be out east so we’re thinking about hooking up there and driving back together. Tell me what’s up. I assume you’re still planning to move to Colorado?
Why didn’t I take any pictures while you were here?
Love,
Lis
Sometimes I have to ask myself am I getting anywhere?
Thankfully, you kept writing to me even though I hadn’t sent you anything in a while.
 
May 12, 1990 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
       Well, I once again wrote you an unsendable letter, full of bitterness and loathing for women who are so willingly victimized by men. This was soon after receiving your letter asking me to “tell you more”. It was in the envelope and I was looking for a stamp, it became clear to me that I would forever regret sending it. I also decided that it would be a while before I tried to write you again. Sorry – I know it frustrates you to have me censor myself, but I would rather seem restrained than demented. There are times when there is no middle choice for me.
       I have never seen Dangerous Liaisons. I think it would be torture for me to watch (based solely on previews and such I have seen). But your description rang a bell for me. I remember once senior year walking home from the computer lab in the middle of winter, the dead of night. Not a soul in sight, everything lit from the streetlights, completely cold and motionless. Petrified, almost, and suddenly I was overwhelmed by just everything (but mostly Sue) and had to stand completely still there on the sidewalk for I don’t know how long before the will to walk again struggled to the surface. Sweet memory.
       I am always alone, too. Physically as well as the other way most of the time. I crave it, I don’t know why. The number of my friends here is dwindling. I am amazed at the void I have made of my life, but I never long for “companionship” or whatever the opposite of solitude is called. When I read you describe your aloneness, though, it drives me up a wall with wanting to be with you. To touch you effortlessly or give that impression. To take your breath away with the contrast between me and everyone else. Makes me bitter, too, though.
       My plans for Colorado are, as they say, indefinitely postponed. I am starting a new job day after tomorrow. My old job turned to incredible hell, and I had to quit, so it looks like I’ll be in Boston a while longer. It would be great to see you and Kira.
love
Brian

I’m not sure why I didn’t send this one. I think I had lost confidence in what I was writing.


 
May 20, 1990 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
	It is my thinking that there are basically two possibilities. The first is that, yes, man is an incredibly complicated, sophisticated, intricate being, and that the reason we don’t understand anything is that the universe is just that much more complicated, sophisticated, and intricate than we. The second, which I am leaning towards, is that the universe is actually quite simple and well-behaved, and that the reason we don’t understand anything is that we are just that much simpler and stupid. It’s not just that we are uncomprehending, we are fundamentally unable to comprehend, even in a universe as marvelously straight-forward as this one seems to be.
	And I don’t just mean “hard” questions like long division and cancer, but “simple” ones like Where did life come from? What is love? Why is there anything at all?
	You can make the argument that, since “everything is relative”, there is no way to distinguish between the two scenarios, but I disagree. In fact, I think this whole “everything is relative” way of thinking is just another symptom of our collective ignorance. I believe that there is one reality, one morality, one truth. Just because none of us can see it clearly doesn’t mean it’s not there. That’s why I’m tired of hearing people claim that each of us has our own reality. Reality is not private, stupidity is.
	Which ends today’s philosophy rant.
	My plans to move to Colorado are, as they say, indefinitely postponed. I quit my old job, which turned to hell, and just finished my first week at a new one. So I will be here in July and would love to see you and Kira.
love
Brian

This is a different approach, at least, but it’s not a very good letter.



 
July 22, 1990 – From Lisa
Dearest Bri,
	It’s been way long. I almost called you the other night but I think I promised once I’d never call you again. No, I’m kidding. I still might.
	A couple of my Chicago friends have deserted me for a couple weeks. Naomi is in Lenox and she dragged Tony off there with her to see her painting show. I’m a little lonely. And as if that weren’t bad enough, from Lenox Tony is heading to NC to see Chris, his friend and the object of my undying desire. Why couldn’t it be me? Actually, though, I know I’ll see him soon. I think this is serious. I also think it’s crazy. Yeehah. I can’t tell you how happy this makes me. I’m totally whipped [?].
	I could go on and on, and if this letter were to reflect the facts of my life proportionately I would because that’s all I think about. But I won’t. The rest of life is pretty interesting too. Everything is starting to happen. Got 2 more jobs, both of which start in the next couple weeks. Back to the Goodman during the days and mixed in there somewhere I’ll be modelling for art classes. And studying for GRE’s. And, I think, taking a class or 2 at Northwestern. And playing my guitar. That is the skeleton of my existence – work, study, play guitar. Basically run myself into the ground. It’s the way I want it though. The more you have to do the more you get done. I’ve actually been studying some, but not enough. I’m starting at Medieval Lit and working my way up. It’s pretty interesting. Not enough time, though, to read everything I’d like to.
	Oh god. My brain feels like jello. How the fuck are you? What are you doing? What is your life? I miss you, Bri. I miss you and your words and your spirit. I don’t want to play catch-up. Fuck the skeleton. The essence of my life is that most of the time I am alone, alone, alone and no one gets through. People getting through gets rarer. (More rare?) I deal with my own problems, my own pain, until I can’t stand it, and the I let someone in. But there aren’t many people who can make a difference. Sweden was hell in a lot of ways. Weird and pained. I finally sent a letter to my parents but I felt like something had gone wrong between us, some kind of disappointment had occurred and I couldn’t figure out who had disappointed whom. It felt shitty. It still does. Margaret understands almost everything, even though she is so different from me. She understands my craziness.
	Karen and I are, I think, starting to work our way back toward something we had a long time ago, something that got lost. Sometimes I feel like I am a shitty friend. Sometimes there is nothing I don’t worry about.
	I told Chris I worried too much about him and me and what to do about it. He said quit your worries. I had a self-inflicted crisis about a week ago in which I felt like I was doomed to disappointment. I tried to tell myself I didn’t care. I cursed his socks for being the only thing left here of him. I sat up on the roof and cried and chain-smoked. That night I had a lucid dream in which I was on a and decided to jump because I knew I would float. I did. Today I am full of hope. Today I know we have all the time in the world. I also know that this thing won’t lose its grip on me, and I won’t go through this again. I’ve got blind faith to burn. This is it for me.
7-24 I know, the odds are against me. But fuck the odds. Fuck ‘em.
	Meanwhile I have to get my mind off it so that I can do some studying… Sometimes I still marvel that I am really doing this grad school thing…
	So Bri. When will I ever see you? I do wish I were more mobile… Anyway, I miss you. I could use one of your great hugs.
Love,
Lis

You hadn’t heard from me in months. Our letters became less frequent after this.






 
August 26, 1990 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
	I’m sorry that my letters have become so infrequent. Partially, it’s due to the things I’ve outlined in previous letters. It also doesn’t help to get letters from you saying how in love you are. I’m sorry, I know that’s an incredibly petty thing to say, and I certainly do wish very much for your happiness. It’s just that there is a certain amount of pain in reading about your love-sickness, and I find it much preferable to ignore it than to deal with it. That’s typically male, I know, but for me it is a new-found skill, and actually I am kind of proud of it, in an embarrassed way.
	The other reason is that I have simply not been inspired to write anything with the urgency that used to seize me. I have been going through long periods of quiescence where nothing can move me much or take me by surprise. This has its pros and cons, as I’m sure you can imagine, but it is also another guilty pleasure. Through I am constantly reminding myself (and occasionally reminded by others) that this is a terribly unhealthy approach to life, I seem to enjoy it immensely. My ability to focus on “tasks” is never higher. And though most such tasks are pretty trivial, it is somehow satisfying to be able to accomplish them at my own rather small pace. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that as a child I spent so much time playing the role of over-achiever, while at the same time everyone knew how dysfunctional I was in terms of practical day-to-day living. I very much enjoy being an under-achiever now.
	And actually it was this kind of thinking that just moved me to write for the first time in a while. I have seen three movies in three days: “Darkman”, “Wild at Heart”, and “Apartment Zero”. (By the way, “Wild at Heart” is the most fucked up movie I have ever seen. Absolutely inexcusably perverse in a very sunny, charming way.) It’s Sunday night and Evan and I rented “Apartment Zero” on tape. It didn’t end until about 12:30 am, at which point I slowly remembered that I had not paid the bills that I intended to pay today. I then realized that it was no big deal, that I could pay them tomorrow or the next day, even though they are already late. Right then I was overwhelmed with the contrast to my life five or ten years ago: all through high school and, to a lesser degree, college.
	In my house, the rule was “No TV until after you’ve done your homework”. At the same time, though, my parents made no attempt to keep track of my assignments. They trusted me to follow the rule. What I would do, then, is not do my homework then watch TV or go out with Peter. If the homework wasn’t due until 4th, 5th, or 6th period I would do it during lunch the next day. If it was due before lunch, I would do it on the bus, producing illegible results most of the time, though my teachers didn’t seem to notice or care. If, however, I had some big assignment due the next day, I would set my alarm for 4:30 or 5:00 and do it before school The alarm would then ring in what was really the middle of the night. I would get up in the dark, my head would ring from the exhaustion, but I would invariably get the work done. I told this to Evan after the credits had rolled, and he said that he couldn’t understand how I forced myself out of bed, that he would simply stay up and do it. For me, though, staying up late to work would be a signal to my parents that I had broken the rule. I had no choice. I know that homework was irrelevant to my real life, but I also knew that it was critical to my present and future happiness. Looking back now, I realized that the pressure I was under then was incredible. Far more than anything I’ve experienced since. The only real pressure I feel now is from work, but this pressure has two qualities that actually make it fun (most of the time): I actually care about the assignments I am given, and I am also given time at work to get the assignments done. The relief I feel when I compare the insanity of school with the excitement of work is amazing. It’s that intense.

This started off as an attempt to write a real letter, but became a rambling diary entry that I never finished.



1991
May 12, 1991 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
I am sorry I have not written or contacted you for so long. I think about you often, but find it very difficult to make anything concrete of it. It’s hard to believe that the last time we were together was over Christmas in Union Station. You were so radiantly happy about your new dude – I hope things are still good with him. You were even talking not-so-offhandedly about marriage, as I recall. That was a bit of a surprise.
Anyway, I have news: I am moving to California next month. It’s definitely a bit sudden and overwhelming, but my company was recently acquired by another company with a branch in Santa Clara (about 70 miles south of San Francisco) to which I was offered a transfer. It was a little too tempting to resist, so Evan and I are now figuring out how to separate after five years of intermingled CDs and shared cats. Everything about Boston has taken on a nostalgic glow (the same one that was missing for me when we all left Brown), and I am realizing that what I am leaving is truly a home. California is still a bit of an unknown – I suppose that’s one of the main reasons I agreed to the transfer. A survey of friends, colleagues (I hate that word), and family indicated that the general feeling was that my life here in Boston had reached a rather stagnant sort of state of complacency. Not that I could completely disagree, but it was a bit of a shock to hear. And, of course, even if true, is it a good reason to pack up and move 3000 miles into who-knows-what? The answer appears to be: “Yes, why not?” Though now I am left to contemplate to what degree I can and should recreate myself once I have relocated. I could, for instance, go by my middle name: “Mitchell”. Close friends would call me “Mitch” and, in one scenario, I would ride my bike back and forth to work (and to my aerobics class). Another possibility involves learning to modulate my tendency to get obsessed with abstractions (e.g. love, the fate of the universe) while becoming totally detached from more concrete things like having a social life and shopping for clothes – I need some new clothes so badly. Of course, it’s hard to see how moving is going to help much with that last one. I’ll keep you posted.
love
Brian

A lot had changed for me since the last time I sent you a letter, including even my handwriting.



December 8, 1991 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
I was back in Boston about a month ago on business. It was great – I got to see Evan and a bunch of other friends – but it was also very strange. I was living in a hotel for two weeks, working late and feeling generally dislocated. Drinking like a fish, that kind of thing. Here is my diary entry for Nov. 6, pretty much verbatim:
Back in Boston on a business trip. It’s almost impossible to make solid contact with he part of me which is able to make these entries. I can feel my spirituality atrophying, and it is so frustrating not to have a satisfying way of expressing and coalescing the thoughts which do surface intermittently. This morning, between snooze alarms, I had a dream about Lisa which came like a pointed reminder that there are other ways living that I am frequently in danger of losing touch with entirely. Such a contrast to this work/eat/sleep approach, as good as it can be. In the dream, I was looking at an abstract painting Lisa had done of a flower. She was in the kitchen on the phone when I realized that the painting was actually not abstract at all, but consisted of a red tulip inside the boundary of a circular blue flower. The tulip appeared to revolve in an orbit around the center of the larger flower. I was amazed. Lisa began singing to her mother, who she was talking with on the phone (only later did I remember that Lisa’s mother is deaf). The song was familiar, but aggravatingly beautiful since I could not acquire it to list to at my leisure. Instead I sat there in the grip of it as it drifted out from the kitchen and away. Then we were watching a film Lisa had made, which seemed intriguing but confusing. Occasionally, I heard Lisa mumbling explanations of various scenes in frustrated response to our inability to interpret the movie (which is completely out of character for the real Lisa). The explanations were enlightening and I wished she would give more. Not a subtle dream, but quick and moving. An econo-dream. Of course, I forgot about it entirely as I walked down the street to work. It was only after finally turning off the light here in my hotel room at 1:30 am that the emptiness found me and sent me in turn back to the memory of the dream and this book to write it down in.
So, you see, the very thought of you still sustains me when I need it. The meaning of the dream seemed clearer when I wrote the diary entry, but I think it was an angry message to myself that there is more to life than software and meetings and crummy bars full of guys in suits with no souls to speak of. So I seized upon my admiration for you and poked myself with it. And then I thought maybe I’d write you a letter and tell you about it.
love
Brian
P.S. I’ll be in DC 12/23 to 1/1. You?

I didn’t send this until several months later. I’m not sure why.

May 3, 1992 – From Lisa
Dearest Brian,
	What do you say we have a reunion? I saw your name on that list and I hand to shout out loud: You stud. I can’t believe how long it has been since that odd evening on Karen’s porch, watching the trees go dark.
	A lot has happened since then, which I am not sure where to start relating on this page – I am hoping that I will see you soon to tell you. Is it true that you will be there, and can I see you?
	I’ll be getting into Providence Friday night, just in time for Campus Dance, and staying in Boston over the weekend. I don’t have the # where I’ll be staying but I will call you before then to see what is up with you. And if I don’t see you, you’ll be getting more of these pages. It has been a long time, and I miss you.
	My new phone is 312 935 4287.
Love,
Lis

Our fifth college reunion was upon us.

 
May 9, 1992 – From Brian
Dear Lisa,
Who could pass up a chance like this? All I really want is to get Jeffy to sign my copy of his book, but I might be able to make a little time for you. Actually my anxiety over this reunion thing is just getting stronger by the day – so many people from so many contexts in one amorphous weekend may send me straight into renal shutdown. I’ve been delaying getting plane tickets, not having any clue as to when to arrive or depart or what to do in-between, but my girlfriend badgered me into it today (plus she made all the phone calls to the airlines, which I hate doing), so I am definitely coming and even have somewhat firm plans – arriving Friday afternoon Boston, driving with Evan to Providence, departing Monday evening Boston, staying in a dorm on-campus (why not?). Plus I am bringing two big scrapbooks of photos from the last ten years in which you are prominently featured.
It has been a long year, but one look at your handwriting on that envelope shrank it to a blip. I thought of you tonight even before I saw your letter. Our lives may be separate, but you are in my heart forever.
Find enclosed a letter that I lacked the balls to send from this past winter.

Helen and I had started dating a few months earlier.


 
June 14, 1992 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Lisa,
Went up to S.F. last night to visit friends we hadn’t seen in several months and took in a KISS cover-band too, replete with 70’s makeup and fake blood. I think they were a little loud for Helen, who is not really a rocker by training (she revealed last night that she twice voted for Reagan). I hate it when people involved in a new relationship drop all their other friends (see Rothfield, Evan 1986-87), but Helen and I have been so wrapped up in various crises and reconciliations that that’s exactly what happened with these friends. They didn’t seem to mind that much, but I reached the point of feeling guilty enough to want to avoid making contact again. I hate the phone when I’m feeling uncomfortable (I read recently someone say, “I’d rather write a book than spend ten minutes on the phone”, which I completely identify with. I think modern phone usage habits are in my top ten reasons for hating corporate America.) Fortunately, Harry (one of the S.F. friends in question) and I are in contact via electronic mail and I was able to make plans that way (but only after he re-established contact with me first).
I notice that I’m starting to speak in the plural (“… visit friends we hadn’t seen…”), which can’t be a good sign, but otherwise things are good here. I’m sure you will agree that it was a complete trip to see and be seen at the reunion. I feel silly afterwards every time I think how psyched I am to see you for the first time after yet another N-year separation, but I know by now that you feel pretty much the same way. (Although I usually do say something completely inappropriate, e.g. my comment to you and Jeff about marriage. I have no sense of propriety when I am drunk and happy.) My mother recently pointed out to me how idealistic I am about relationships with other people, but I like being that way. This came about in a fairly dramatic way, which I will now bore you with (if I can find a pen that works). While speaking with Risa Wolfson in a causal and uninterested way about the fate of Sue Dimmock, who failed to materialize at the reunion, I learned that Sue has decided to excommunicate all her Brown friends (except, apparently, Risa herself). It turns out that Sue has not been a particularly happy person since graduation and I gather that she is too embarrassed/chagrined/angry to see any of us. Aside from a slight sense of satisfaction (of the it-serves-her-right variety), I actually felt pretty badly about this and immediately embarked on a pointless effort to judge the proportion of this dictum that was directed at me. I did not want to underestimate, because I have done some really rotten things to Sue for which to this day I seek absolution, but I did not want to over-estimate either, since I was but one of Sue’s many dysfunctional Brown friends. Having already spent several years misjudging my effect on Sue’s behavior, this line of though quickly put me on a familiar downward spiral. Fortunately, I recognized the scenery and moved off almost as quickly, but not before returning home and mentioning to Helen (just after making love, poor timing) that I was thinking of writing to Sue that I was sorry if it was me that she was avoiding. This did not go over well, especially since Helen can be quite jealous in a charmingly un-liberated way. Helen immediately declared that our relationship was over since I was still in love with Sue (rather ironic comment coming from a married woman, but I tried not to dwell on this). When I protested Helen decided that only my mother, who is a therapist, could reliably determine whether I really was in love with Sue, the very thought of which sent me to within an inch of catatonia. Consulting my mother on this Kafka-esque question was not terribly attractive, but Helen was determined (claiming that only my mother knew me, and psychotherapy, will enough to provide an objective opinion), so I reluctantly agreed. It wasn’t until several argument-filled days later that it occurred to me that it was a really, really bad idea, but by then it was too late: the scheduled tele-conference between Helen and me (in our office in Santa Clara) and mother (in VA) was only hours away. My mother had been almost unbearably angry at Sue (who she barely knew), and the thought of my current girlfriend ruining my mother, myself, and my relationship with my mother with a single well-placed comment about my hopelessly unrelieved, unrequited love for this nobody was almost comical in a Woody Allen kind of way. There was one bombshell in particular that Helen seemed intent on dropping on my mother until my begging and pleading convinced her not to. It seems that early in my relationship with Helen, I had said to her that were Sue to call and ask to marry me (a hypothetical situation akin in probability to the Red Sox winning the World Series), that I would be unwilling to say no, having taken a vow at the depths of my longing for Sue that I would never turn her away as she had me. While I am unwilling and unable to truly defend this statement it does contain a little coded granule of truth that I do stand by. It was this comment that Helen, many months later, was truly upset about, and it was the comment that she intended to thrust at my mom, hoping, I think for sympathy in return. So, anyway, we called my mother, sitting together around a circular table in her boss’s office speaking at a phone on the table. It was about as weird as you might imagine, but things were actually going OK since by that point Helen and I had reconciled to some degree and my mother was tolerating our excuse for the call in a particularly impressive, amused kind of way. I think my mother has become quite advanced since I left home. I then decided to relay the “marriage statement” to my mom myself, feeling that this way I could let Helen express her full concern while controlling the delivery myself. My mother did not flip out, as I had feared. She was not mad at Helen, or at me, or even at Sue for this terribly weird comment that I had made. She instead calmly pointed out something so true me that I had missed it completely myself. And something so non-obvious that I was amazed that she knew it (she is, after all, only a mom). She told Helen that since I was a teenager I have always idealized my relationships and that she should try to see my comment in this light, not as a statement about Sue but as a statement about me. And it’s true. I do idealize people, without regret. I idealize you.
love, Brian
Will be in the DC area over July 4th. Would love to see you.

Again, I didn’t send this until months later.
The long story about Helen and my mom doesn’t strike me as either interesting or amusing any more, but I guess it did lead to a valuable insight about my idealism.

Dear Lisa,
I wrote the enclosed letter months ago but wondered afterwards whether it would be at all comprehensible. I send it anyway, as per your frequent urgings.
Also find enclosed the ticking shirt you have always lusted after. I think you mentioned at reunion (you were probably drunk) that I should send it to you.
Am thinking of you often, and missing you. Perhaps it would be worth visiting you? What do you think? Maybe you could come out here.
love,
Brian

The famous ticking shirt!
 

September 2, 1992 – From Lisa
Dearest Bri, 
The ticking couldn’t have come at a better time. I donned it immediately. That night, my persistent funk lifted. Yah, sure, some other good stuff happened. But it happened while I was wearing the ticking. That’s the waikiki of it. The very waikiki of it… I also got great enjoyment out of the fact that one line of your letter could very easily be misread as: “Also find enclosed the fucking shirt you have always lusted after.”
Very interesting goings on in your life there, Bri. The saga about the phone call just cracked me up, even as I was absorbing the impact of it. Your mother is a cool woman. I am wondering if she had met Helen, or if she has by now. I was surprised to find that I have a very precise image of what Helen looks like in my head, but I also realize that most of it comes from a woman who is with a guy I know who reminds me a little of you, though now that I think about it, I had absolutely no idea until this moment that he reminded me of you. So anyway, I’m glad you remembered my urgings and sent that letter, and no, I don’t think I was drunk when I asked for the ticking. I don’t think I ever got drunk that evening, and I agree that it was a hoot to be there. Plunk. Here we are. Different evolutions of the same human beings, stomping on the old ground. It was a little difficult for me to see people and know that there would be no time to reconnect as much as I would have liked, but it is true what you said, that I too am always ridiculously happy to see you.
I found out yesterday that my oldest friend, Paul, my playmate from age three, got married recently. A spur of the moment thing, and I must say that I feel a bit robbed. I just can’t believe it’s done. Not a great surprise, as he’s been with this woman for a couple years, but I didn’t get to be happy for him in an external way. Strange business, this marriage thing. Tahir’s is fast approaching. I just can’t wait – it has not been easy for him being separated from his fiancé all this time. All I know is I better not wear mascara. Not that I ever do anyway…
I’ve been having psychic flashes lately. One great thing that happened, the night of the ticking, was that I met a woman who I know I have known before. It was like meeting an old and dear friend. The uncanny thing is that looking at her was like looking in a mirror. She looks more like me than Margaret does. I had seen a picture of her – she is a good friend of a friend of mine – a couple weeks before, and couldn’t stop looking at it. And meeting her in person, I couldn’t stop looking at her. We had to sit next to each other all evening because it was too distracting to try to talk and look at each other at the same time… Very cool, and not just the physical thing, but the energy we got from each other. She was like a part of me that wants to come out more, and vice versa. So it was difficult to meet her and then say goodbye immediately, which is what we had to do since she lives in California. But I have a feeling that was not the last time we will meet, and since then it is odd to say, but I have felt her with me. She is waiting to hear from grad schools in northern CA and in Chicago. And meanwhile I am thinking about where I want to go next. I have recently been through a series of frustrations and realizations that have given me a swift kick toward going back to school, the main thing being that I am butt-tired of doing the splits, and having the way I make a living have nothing to do with what I live for. I find it remarkable what a deplorable state of existence I have been willing to put up with – running myself ragged over paying my rent, taking every bit of work that comes, scheduling myself up the butt, leaving no breathing room for my mind and spirit. All this time I have been lamenting that poetry doesn’t pay, but part of that is a convenient excuse to maintain a certain comfort level that the distractions provide, a way to avoid the gut wrenching that poetry often involves. But there was no joie either, and that sucked the root, to use one of my favorite expressions from Jeff’s book. So I am making another leap of faith, of the things-take-care-of-themselves variety; I realized that making ends meet had assumed way too much importance in my life, and that I had already spent years learning that you get what you need, and what was I in panic mode for?
As a result, I have spent the last three days, my first real time off in ages, doing nothing but read and write, write and read. I had decided a while back that the three loves of my life were vegetables, poetry, and weightlifting, but yesterday I decided that, on a relative scale, vegetables and weightlifting can go to hell. Every once in a while I kick myself for loving such a complicated beast, but anything less would bore me. Maybe that’s why I’m a spinster… oh I just couldn’t resist.
So who knows, I may have even more reason to head out west soon. I have been flirting with the idea of going back east, maybe UVA or something, but I know deep down that I have to be a bit more of an expatriate than that in order to be at my best. Let me know if you have heard anything about good writing programs out there. I’m definitely in the market for one… Naomi has just packed herself off to Rochester for a one year masters in art education. She is terrified but happy. Such a funny woman. She has yet another man in the long string of ‘em. And I’ll state here and now for the record, he’s a loser. I’m afraid it’s the need-attracts-need, cling-meets-cling phenomenon. On top of all that, he’s twenty-two and jobless and has followed her to Rochester to live with her, after meeting her oh, a good two months ago… It Doesn’t Bode Well.
The only real potential for romantic – see I can’t even spell the damn word, manicromanlunatic – excitement in my life is hopelessly entangled with the ideal: My friend and old Lenox flame, David, whom I haven’t seen in almost three years, is returning from the Peace corps in a few weeks. And during those years I have loved him like crazy across continents and oceans; he is one of the giants of my heart. Yet even as I have idealized him, I have found great relief in freely exposing my weaknesses to him. After a couple pages of one such confessional spurt, I wrote, “I confess: I am a stupendous goddess, riddled with skeletons and gaps.”
There is something very beautiful about the way you idealize. Having never been inside your head about it, I don’t know where it comes from, but having been on the other end I can say that it feels like it comes not from expectation but from your version of the absolute truth; your idealism has guts and conviction and a pulse, and I wouldn’t regret it either if I were you.
Thanks so much for the fucking shirt.
Love,
Lis

I think you sometimes understood me better than I understood myself.

October 3, 1995 – From Lisa
Dearest Brian and Helen, 
I’ve been meaning to do this for ages now, and I do hope I have the right address, god, I am so out of touch! I’m afraid I don’t have much time at the moment but I just couldn’t put it off any longer. I think of you guys much more often than is apparent…
Karen passed the news along that you are expecting. Congratulations! I guess it must be any time now. Please let me know. I have been thinking babies an awful lot these days. You may have heard through said grapevine that I met my true match, and couldn’t be happier about it. His name is Peter. We met one day last summer as I was walking by the lake. He came up and laid a dumb line on me and I was a goner. I just knew from the git go.
And meanwhile I’m working on my master’s again, this time at Northwestern. I just started this fall, part-time. It will probably take three years or so, but I’m in no rush. I just want to be learning. So far so good – the one class I’m taking is poetry writing. Part workshop, part discussion and study of major texts. The professor is quite excited about it, a good sign. And so am I. Unfortunately, this type of course seems to be a rarity, and much of the faculty thinks creative writing has no place in an English department. Humbug! But I’m happy to have started out this way, and to have hooked up with this professor so early on. I get the feeling he will be a help to me throughout. I LOVE poetry.
For rent I am still doing shows. Just started a nice easy gig at a theater down the street, in which there are a total of two changes that I am involved in. The rest of the time I close my door and study or knit, as the spirit moves me…
And the news about other folks we know: Kira is getting married Oct. 14th in Tuscan. It’s a family-only wedding, then they’ll have a reception here a couple weeks later for friends. I’m sad I won’t be able to celebrate the day with them. There’s nothing like that. I have great memories of that whole weekend of your wedding, and I just can’t imagine getting married without all of the people I love right there with me. (Karen and I, by the way, since that weekend, have gotten back on track in a lovely way. She is so dear to me. Ain’t that grand? And you had a hand in it. – make sure you tell your dad.) I don’t know if you’ve talked with Karen recently. She’s having trouble with her ankles again, so much so that she is probably going to withdraw from the post-bac program she’s been in at the Art Institute. Send some good ankle vibes if you can. And Mary, well, she’s Mary. As per the rule that all four of us (me, Karen, Mary, Kira) can’t be all on speaking terms at any given time, Karen and Mary have been in a stand-off for well over a year now, and Kira, unable to elicit a response from Mary after a rough spot, didn’t invite her to to the wedding reception. Some things never change…
Back to work with me. I have class tonight. I am thinking of you and hope you are well and happy. Brian, I was thinking of you on your birthday.
       XXOO Love, Lisa
Other good news – my sister is moving to Chicago. I’m so excited. She and her boyfriend are still in England but both are getting out of the spy business and coming out here next year. I’m planning a trip to Europe in March, before she moves back.
Three years had gone by without any letters.

 
October 18 & 22, 1995 – From Brian
Dear Lisa, 
We’re actually planning to use the name Kira if the baby’s a girl, so I’m sure there’s some deeper significance to the fact that it was due on the 14th, the day of Kira M.’s wedding. I also knew a girl named Kira Summerbell (isn’t that a pretty name?) in high school — I wonder what happened to her. On the other hand, we’ll use Ellis if the baby’s a boy. As you can imagine, we’re dying to find out either way, but nothing’s happening yet. We’ll induce labor by the end of the week at the latest, but for now we’re still hoping that things will kick-start themselves before then.
Are you thinking of having a baby yourself? (You hinted as much in your letter.) I had heard that you were seeing someone, but I didn’t know that he was your “true match”. I knew you’d meet him eventually, and I guess it’s happened. I have to confess that when I met Helen, I had no idea that we’d end up together. Love/romance/sex (and all the gradations in between) are so important to me, but I was always my own worst enemy. I still don’t really understand how to get from A to B when it comes to good lovin’, I’m just grateful to Helen for getting me there. Anyway, it makes me happy to think of you with someone you love. And I also think you’d make a wonderful sweet mother should you be so inclined. I can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to being a dad. It seems like the world is opening up for me in an amazing new way.
Karen is very good about calling me every so often, usually on the pretext of asking a computer question, so I did know that her ankles were bothering her again. I’m pleased that you’re back on friendly terms (and if that means Mary is the odd one out for the time being, well, gosh, so be it). I should apologize for sometimes lumping you and Karen together in my mind; I’m sure it’s annoying. I think I’ve idealized our old friendships, so current-day realities sometimes suffer by comparison. It’s not nostalgia really (hell, to be honest, I’d never go back to those days), more like loyalty. As a result, you, too, are on my mind more than I express.
Elsewhere, Evan and Jeanne were married last month and are now in the midst of traveling the globe. They had a nice ceremony up in the boonies of New Hampshire. Jeffs got a story about the Beatles on the cover of the latest “Newsweek”. Peter (Fiori) is living in Colorado and seems to be going through a rather harsh break-up with his girlfriend. I think he’s itching to settle down and start a family, but she isn’t ready for anything that permanent. My cousin Steve moved to California and, last we heard, has broken up with his girlfriend.
It looks like we’ll probably move back to DC sometime next year in order to be closer to family and buy a house in a warmer area. I’ll miss Boston, but Helen doesn’t like the cold much. My once-great job has turned to shit, but I’m trying to hold on because the company’s headquarters are in Rockville, providing much-needed continuity in the event of a move. In the meantime, my self-respect is a little wobbly and I have fantasies about quitting and starting my own software company. Unfortunately, I don’t think it’s going to happen, at least not this time around. I’m worried that I’m becoming a mercenary and that $$$ are polluting my mind. Gee, I love capitalism.
It’s great to hear from you, Lis. Let’s keep it up. We’ll send you a birth announcement when the baby comes. Helen sends her love.
Ellis was born about a week later, on the 28th.
 
December 12, 1995 – From Lisa
Dear Brian and Helen,
	Congratulations! I was so happy to hear about Ellis. He must be bringing great joy… I’ve been meaning to call and was about to just now but realized it was too late there. So this doubles as congrats and happy holidays.
	I will actually be in D.C. just after the holidays – Jan. 3 - Jan 7. Will you still be around? I would love to see you all, and Peter will be with me. He’s meeting the family in toto – my mom was just here for a week, and that was the first time he’d met anyone in my family. About time. Things are great with him. I love him more every day. As for the rest of my life, all that I care about I have had to suspend for a time, while I make a living. I finished my first class at Northwestern [?], then immediately switched from academic dreamy thinking/reading/writing mode to assembly-lining black and white dance costumes all day. Yikes. Dov’é la poesia? I’m taking winter quarter off since I couldn’t find a class I wanted to take (!), so I’ll be self-motivated for a while, trying to schedule my own work into the rest. Anyway, let me know if you will still be home (in D.C.) in Jan. My # here is 312 472 3154 and at mom and dad’s is 301 593 0645. Hope to see you soon. Love to all of you.
XXOO Love,
Lisa



 



Correspondence: 1982 – 1993
Introduction
Dear Melissa,
I decided to collect our correspondence in one place, and I transcribed most of the letters to make them easier to read (and searchable). Herein find every letter between us that I have, in chronological order through 1993 (including letters I wrote but didn’t send), with comments where I think they might be helpful. All the early letters are from you, because I don’t have copies of what I sent you.
These letters mean a lot to me – a story that we created together. Thank you for corresponding with me over the years.
love,
Brian

1982
July 1, 1982 – From Melissa
Dear Bri,
Peter’s a great fisherman, need I say more? So how’s gov[ernor]’s school treating you? Dan Harasty went there last year, and so did my friend Kathryn Ficke (our thespian Pres.) Actually, my cousin Chris (Jones, of course) went year before last. He goes to UVA. If you expect this to be a continuation of massive sex description like Marcia’s letter, you may be wrong. I am mellow. Peter is reading this and drooling on my shoulder as he does so. I think it is rather humorous that you are incarcerated much in the same way we are as I write this? Except that you are developing your intellect while we sweat, slave and are put to menial manual labor jobs. I’ve painted about a square mile of rooms and planted a tree (we had to dig a huge hole and use shovels and picks and I got a BLISTER! Me, the one who lives in constant, blissful and uninterrupted luxury. I made the utter sacrifice and really made the decision to “rough it” when I left my hair dryer at home. In fact, I have even stopped caring about having mascara under my eyes, or if I have on blush or if any male persons are in the room while I take off my clothes. No biggie, you say; well fêchez-vous, Brian.
Today we are going to a real live strip mine, are you thrilled? Peter is laughing at my witty first line of my letter. He wants me to fill in details. Hmm, now he says “no details”. Juicy detail no. 1: Pete and I are the “best of friends”. All these people are reading this while I write. It’s enough to drive one crazy. Now I will relate the adventures of Mash in an endearing tone of voice. She manages the entire Bible School singlehandedly and wet nurses, along with Tricia, the smaller children in the school as there isn’t enough milk to go around. When we run out of milk here they will have to accommodate the guys. Aren’t they saints?
Peter is not pleased that both Marcia and I have written longer letters to you than he will himself. To tell the truth, I doubt you’ll ever get a letter from him. I really think he’s cracking. He’s reading the Harlequins and the Barbara Cartlins that the girls have discarded. In fact, he’s even agreed to sign Tricia’s yearbook. The other day he didn’t talk to Marcia or me for about four hours because we jokingly said something about Tricia and he was offended. We were shocked. The same night P. and I had our big blowup and I yelled “Goddammit Peter” so that the whole youth group heard and he said “fucking” 3 times in one sentence and I ran away and Trish and Mash came and calmed me down and P. came and talked to me for like 3 hours (until 2:00 in the morn) about everything in the world. He was a sweetheart. He spilled out his heart to me and did it so eloquently that I almost went crazy. And then last night I was so incredibly massively worried about him. He was a naughty boy and went running and met some “cool guys” who offered him Stroh’s and some kind of whiskey, which he accepted, of course. He came back to our meeting and to watch the movie and said he felt like he was tripping. The “cool guys” had put something in the liquor and most everyone said they thought it had been Quaaludes. He looked like he was lost in space. I walked around with him afterwards and kept asking him if he was okay and he said about 18 million times “I’m gonna fuckign die” and “you’re a great gal, Miss”. It was bizarre and I was scared. Is this letter too long and boring? It didn’t start out to be. It’s much too serious. Are you going to come and visit me with Pete next year at Oberlin? He says he’ll come every other weekend and drive me around in his hot rod. Peter Sebestyen gave Karen 3 massive hickeys. She is embarrassed. Now they are given her more. Peter F. is directing. Jaap is my bro and Beth and I had a paint fight. Suzy is about to take a picture of me. If this gossip doesn’t exactly qualify as juicy, I send you my regrets. Fêchez-vous!
My sincerest wishes that you will no longer despise me,
       💙Missy
P.S. All the guys are lusting after Beth Seiler’s body. Gag me with a homosexual rectal thermometer!

I was at the Governor’s School in Lynchburg, while you all were at Buckhorn.
 
Peter and my dad came to pick me up when I got out on July 7.







July 11, 1982 – From Melissa
Dear One,
Picture this, if you will: Melissa Jones, desolate, forgotten, criminal, incarcerated for days on end in her own abode without any hope of salvation or human society other than that of her mother. She takes refuge in trashy novels which feature lesbian sex scenes and incest between brothers. She has lain for three hours, intact and wholly absorbed in her most recent trashy piece? piece?? peece??? peace !! of literature, when her afore-mentioned mother (refer to above phrases) deposited roughly into her lap a missile from the very Brian to whom this lengthy and ridiculous parchment is addressed. What joy! What rapture! Such frantic glee and amiability (is that a word? Tell me; no don’t tell me) unabounded. I think I must have read that letter 15 times over. I used it as a bookmark until the last very page of my trashy pece of literature. Since you wrote “write back” in megasized letters, I decided I would. I probably would have anyway. I know I would have anyway. Does receiving letters at Gov. School make one hot shit? Receiving Brian letters at Buckhorn makes me hot shit, that is a certainty. I am weird and eloquent tonight. It’s because I got new shorts and I am going away to live on a house boat for a whole week with my sister and her boyfriend, sans maman. Get a French student to decipher that one.
So what’s new? I really was pleased that you sent me a letter. There is nothing more precious in life than letters (my opinion – you would probably differ – I know Peter would.) (Does that annoy you? I am referring to something I just noticed that I do. When I talk about Peter, I always refer to him as if I were the expert on the subject. Of course I’m not, but did you ever notice that? Does it disturb you to find faults in yourself? (Do you ever find faults in yourself?? – Do not let me digress – I was discussing something important.) I’ll have to stop doing that. If anyone here is an expert, it’s you “Super Brian to the Rescue” himself! It’s blicky to not be an expert on anything, not even oneself! But how would I know? I am an expert on perverseness. (“Perverse” is my newest vocab word. I use it instead of “weird,” “bizarre” or “queer”. I like it.)
I bet I know something that you and Peter do a lot. Do you ever have the same thought at the same time, and say it at the same time? Not silly things, like if you see something, both of you, and comment on it, but real significant, progressive thoughts. That is fantastic. I do that with Holly constantly (that is, whenever we’re in each other’s company.) And we also somehow telepathically begin to sing the same song, either in our heads or out loud. (I know you are thinking to yourself; is this pointless or what? Is the entire letter going to be like this? Hold your beans, Brian dear. Letters can be/should be both informative and entertaining. This happens to be the entertainment portion. Later comes the juicy gossip.) ANYWAY, the other day Peter and I had the same thought once. It was so neat! I doubt he remembers it though.
Oh wow – I just read back over this letter and it is confusing! You will be forced to read it several times over. But that is good for me. Peter was pissed (I never use that word! But in this case it really fits so I had to use it. Forgive me.) because you didn’t write him a letter back and he just wrote you a letter of enormous importance and heartrending significance. I argued that it wasn’t a very long letter, and not typed. Oh, by the way, I had intended to type this letter, but I am at a friend’s house and away from my brand new delicious electric typewriter that I got as a graduation present. I took typing for a semester when I was a junior and was pretty good (45 W.P.M. – with about 10 mistakes P.M.) but I have lost the talent. I am at Beth’s house and Angela’s here and Holly’s coming. (My restriction is becoming less a life-threatening situation, although my mother still says to me as she leaves the house, “Don’t do anything you have to lie about.” Such a priceless woman.) Beth and Peter and I went on an adventure to the creek that becomes the Potomac. We climbed all over rocks to get to it and walked for seemingly endless miles and finally camped out on some lovely rocks deep in the woods. We got wet and Beth got buzzed and Peter got genuinely tipsy. I drank ½ of 2 beers and flung a third can (full and ice cold) into the fast part of the water. B. and P. were not amused. P. made me go look for it but I pulled him in and we almost drowned. We found black spermies in the wet crevasses of rocks. P. said they were tadpoles. Hmm. My mom told me I could never see Peter again because he was “nothing but trouble” for me, but it only serves to make us more determined in missing each other and enjoying stolen, secret clandestine phone calls in the dead of night and meetings. When I’m 18 (little more than a month left!), she cannot censor my friends or my social life. And P. will have a car and… and I don’t know what. I’m not going to plan anything or search for certainties because I can’t count on them or on being right or on myself! If that is clear to anyone, it must be clear to you! Oh, I’m going to miss everyone dreadfully when I go away but it is about time I went. High school is the pits, and so is being underaged. The best thing about being that young is being innocent, and naïve and untouched and untainted by all the corrupt people doing adult things with their lives, and thinking about how wonderful the future will be. Marcia is the prime example of that and I envy her. I think I’m still like that – I feel that way, but I notice things, like what goes on around me. But it doesn’t really hit home. I am a baby! What about you, Brian my friend? Are you just a straight arrow?
Letters are fantastic vehicles for one’s inner frustrations! Do you yearn (urine) for juicy gossip yet? Mash’s in North Carolina and Reesh is away too. I wore her bathing suit on the 4th and it kept falling down. Peter likes Beth’s body a great deal and dislikes blood. Holly is a hot girl and my mother doesn’t trust me even a little bit. I am sly. My sister is a terrific chick and I can’t wait to see her!! Beth Seiler can’t decide which guy to go out with, oh no! Mash is 37D and if you tell her I told you, you die. P. thinks he met Bruce, the Boss, on the 4th. I am reading The World According to Garp. Give me a break, Brian! So this is awful. I’ve been hidden from the sun for 5 days! I need light to grow! Send topsoil.
Oh, enclosed in this perverse (there’s that word) care package are a few items of interest. Item A is part of a ticket stub that came into my possession recently. Peter and Regan saw some modern play at the Folger. Keep it. Someday it could be worth millions.
Item B is a step toward better nutrition. Use it wisely. It came from the McLean McDonald’s when B, P and I ate there.
Had enough? So have I. Writer’s cramp can cause impotency, you know.
WRITE and ye shall know your salvation!
Be good. Don’t touch girls below the waist.
in termination, my fond regard
Missy💙
P.S. How do you spell “peice”?
P.P.S Write a longer letter next time!

This letter was pretty amazing at the time (and still is).



September 14, 1982 – From Melissa
Dear Brian-type,
You are the sunshine of my life! Your letter absolutely brightened up my entire day! It didn’t make my headache go away but it came as close to it as possible. Today was an especially good day for mail for me – I got two (count em, two!) packages from my mother, and a letter from Da[?] Hurasty and a letter from my friend Catherine. And yesterday I got a package of homemade (?) cookies from Jeannie Quinn! So, strictly speaking, I should be obligated to write back to Jeannie first, since your letter not only came a day later, but contained no edible items, but Jeannie will have to wait. Your letter contained wit, imagination and good will.
Everything here is fantastic! College life is just about everything it’s cracked up to be, with a few exceptions. There is freedom, responsibility, work, fun, friends. When you wake up at 7:00 in the morning to the cacophonous clamor of your stupid clock radio blasting “Oh yeah, life goes on” and you realize that it is all up to you whether or not you make it to your 8:00 class; no one else will help or care – you begin to realize that you have to take hold of the things that you want. Doing laundry is an incomparable experience – the same with going to the bank, living on a budget, deciding to spend your whole weekend encased within the library, instead of writing letters or going to movies. But, don’t worry, I haven’t exactly killed myself with working yet. I had a great deal of homework this weekend – I spent Saturday and Sunday from 1-4 or 5 at Mudd (some the time I slept). My classes are (if you haven’t heard already): Theory (a hell of a class to get into, but I need it), voice lessons for 2 credit hours (yay!), Chems [?], Philosophy, (a great class – but very deep), intro to Narrative Fiction (compared to A.P. English, this course will be a breeze!), Acting 100 (which I got into thru a lottery – luck, luck, luck!) and Modern France – an intermediate-adv. conversation course. The hardest yet! Today I only had 1 class – French at 11:00. So, of course, I slept late. But I needed it.
For thrills (if you can call them that), we go to movies (we saw Animal House, Play it Again Sam, World According to Garp, Cocktail Molotov) or concerts (we saw Grass Roots Revival and Livingston Taylor) or we dance the hours away at the disco or hang out at the Rat. My best friends at this point are Susan and Stephanie – Susan is double degree in voice and theatre, and wild. She spends all her time in our quad these days, though, because her roommate is just too weird. And Stephanie is a piano major and plays better than anyone I ever heard. My roommates are all clean, couth girls, but I doubt I’ll ever be close friends with any of them. Carin is beautiful, but too rich-blooded, aloof and princessish. Anne is very sweet and neat, but she’s close with Carin; Beth is hyper – stays home and studies all the time! I like it here!
Brian, the reason you’d fit in here is because there is no one who doesn’t. All the college majors are brains, all the con[servatory] majors are brilliant, all the in-betweens are artsy, driven, talented, brilliant. Everyone is interesting. The punks tolerate the preps (though there are few of those) and everyone is happy in a unique existence, ebony and ivory together in perfect harmony. Get the idea? Of course, I am exaggerating, but, Brian, I cannot imagine going anywhere else but here. U.V.A. would be just like Herndon High compared to this place. I cannot imagine being in any school where they have frats or sororities. Those are bad words here, luckily, luckily, luckily. Trish would not last a week here, neither would Julie Romance (does the Fun Nun still live?) and the lot.
I’m writing this as I sit in our lounge at the end of the hall – we’re having a section meeting! Yay. They’re telling us about party regulations, fire hazards, drinking age and other truly exciting things that are necessary in college life. The drinking age is so screwed up here! One has to be 19 to drink beer (and it’s only 3.2 beer, which tastes like fermented water) and the age for wine and everything else is 21. And, to top it off, Oberlin is a dry county. All one can even buy here is 3.2 beer anyway! So, Brian, if you are going to make a habit of your little escapade at Suzy’s, this is not the place for you. But congratulations on that anyway. Since you asked, I don’t think I have ever been drunk in the manner that our Peter is used to – mostly just a little giddy and happy. When I was on the houseboat, (we did a lot of drinking – they did a lot of  smoking) – but one night we had a great tequila party where I out-drank everybody and was generally in a good mood.
We’re having a pizza party tonight! Susan and I already went around and delivered invitations and they deliver! Oh joy, oh rapture! I have little homework tonight, happily, tra-la-, tra-la, although I have an 8:00 class tomorrow. (This is grodey – they keep stressing how responsible we all have to be – I feel like I’m on a retreat, where Gary spends eons of time telling us how we shouldn’t waste our “religious experience” on the nasty, mundane business of our everyday, worldly lives – namely, Tricia and Suzy, don’t be so cliquish, Mark and Harrison lay off the booze, Missy and Peter no more hickey contests in the Pinders’ van.) Speaking of which, why isn’t he writing to me?? I don’t mean to sound totally desperate, but it would be nice to hear from him. I’ve written twice! Believe it or not, Brian dear, I’ve been totally faithful (yes, I must admit that Darcy has rejected my suit) – so who is he going out with/conducting an affair with? My guess are:
	Kara S.	Matty	Julie R.	?
	Regan	Beth S.	Helena B.
Now it is 11:15 and we just had a pizza party with 10 people (if you have a party with more than 10 people, you have to register it with the dorm staff and card people at the door if liquor is served.) Isn’t this a long letter? It is the longest and most rambling I’ve written yet. But I have so much homework tomorrow – and an 8:00 class! – that I have to end it. You’ve been entertaining, my dear! Please do write back, and I really hope you do decide to come visit. I’m sure I could arrange to have you put up for the night. Tell Peter I still love him but if he doesn’t write soon, that’s it, I’ll join the Gay Union.
             * Love, Trust, Friendship, Sincerity Always
            ♡Missy
* How’s that?
P.S. I got the part of Starveling in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”! Excitement! It is to be directed by students who are taught by the 6 people visiting from the Royal Shakespeare Company!
P.P.S. Yes, I’m feeling great after “you-know-what”. Aren’t I resilient? Does this mean I can’t ever be Miss America?

This is your first letter to me from Oberlin.

“I’m an alchoholic (sic)”
“I’m failing school”
       -Peter Fiori to Melissa Jones in a letter dated Oct 14
“Choir sucks”
“Teachers hate me”
“School sucks”
       -Sept 30 letter
“All my teachers hate me this year”
       -Sept 20 letter

Dearest Bri,
What a significant boost to my ego that my letters have the power to prompt such an immediate and impassioned reply as I received in your obviously heartfelt letter. In your own words, ”That was one doosey of a letter.” It was unnecessary for me to read any further than the words, “...letter we got today,” to realize that I had probably been partially, if not completely, misunderstood. Thank you, Brian, again you have performed the amazing task of totally clouding the issue in that unique way of yours. First off, let me say that I find it typical, almost predictable, that you, not Peter (to whom the letter was addressed, by the way) would reply in such a fashion as you did. “Who the hell appointed you God, Lord Protectorate of Peter Fiori?” Nobody appointed me, darling – may I ask the same of you? 
Before I proceed any further, let me also state my assumption that, like myself, you are not taking any sort of artificial energy supplement. I hope this assumption is correct. 
Now, before I attempt to clarify myself where I was so obviously misunderstood before, I feel I must clear myself of the blame of committing those “greivous(sic) errors” which you so rashly attribute to me. I refer to the above quotations, all of which have been pulled from recent, legitimate letters between the concerned parties. Brian, after being told repeatedly and with beaucoup sincerity by Peter that he is an alcoholic, I believed him. I meant no offense and definitely no slander (rather careless of you to use such a strong and unpleasant word where it does not apply, wasn’t it?); rather, I was simply quoting Peter in order to make a point. Second, why do you refer to my statement, “You don’t have to have all your teachers hate you, or fail all your classes, or be an alcoholic,” as “crap,” and why do you ask if “this stuff is to be taken literally?” What is this problem you seem to be having with basic comprehension? The point of my letter (which, as I said before, you evidently missed) was to say to Peter that he has alternatives, and very strong ones, to doing all of the above. You accuse me of condemning Peter’s lifestyle, being egocentric in that I think mine is the only true and right way to exist, etc., etc… But you failed to remember, or perhaps didn’t even realize when you wrote your fire and brimstone letter, that Peter himself repeatedly condemned what was happening in his life, and the results of his actions and the general effect on everything, and constantly wrote me letters which I interpreted to mean that he was sinking and he knew it and he wanted help. I tried to point out to him that we were all trying to help him – I gave you ample credit, didn’t I, Brian? – but that he had to wake up and help himself first. You try to tell me that “Peter is a young man who is doing his best in life,” but do you really believe this shit? That is not the impression that Peter has been giving me all along. Sure, I don’t deny that I have my own fixed ideas about what Peter could be doing to make he existence a little less rocky (if I may use so mild a term), but I certainly don’t think that I shoved any of them down his throat. It is obvious to me that you think me devoid of any compassion or feeling for him anymore, but I would never have written a letter in which I tried to tackle some of the problems I knew (or thought) existed. If this were true. And I never said that any of it was any more than my personal opinion.
I’m sorry, but I don’t associate the phrase, “be yourself” with bell-bottom jeans and Sammy Davis Jr. Is it so asinine to entreat someone to dispense with artificiality and just plain bullshit? I loved Peter for all the real things I saw in him, all the parts of himself that didn’t come about because of – yes, I am forced to use the term, trite as it may be – peer pressure. And while we’re on the general subject, yes, I admit it, I do not think that Peter handles peer pressure well. Who does? You, Brian? – I am not saying that I exactly rise above this either. (Even those of us on our thrones cannot escape unscathed.) YOU, my dear boy, lambast me (great word, by the way) for making statements to Peter about “getting brutalized... not acting like himself (when he’s brutalized), throwing up, etc., not to mention the Big Mistake — but do you, or Peter, deny that these things have over occurred? You say, ”I thought you knew Peter, you loved him for so very long, but I guess you don’t.” How’s that again? I ask you, do you deny the truth of Peter’s behavior, which is what seems to be in dispute here. Also, I must express my complete inability to follow your train of thought — you say you’ve had the very same thoughts I’ve had (which thoughts are you alluding to here?), but you hit your head against a wall whenever you begin to fool sorry for yourself like I am doing. I’m glad that you are able to make such an amazing recovery, but what the hell are you talking about? I do not feel sorry for myself. I regret that I am forced to stand trial for the horrible crime of trying to dictate another’s life. I honestly did not mean my “sermon” in that manner and I’m sorry if it had to be taken that way. I am also sorry that you seem to be so sure that Peter is “only doing what he thinks is right.” I don’t agree. That was my original point and I was trying to offer some sort of help where it was asked for and I thought, expected. I was wrong. (You see? I don’t have all the answers. I am sorry if this disillusions you.)
No, Brian, I do not proclaim myself “Most Incredible Responsibility Taker.” I give this dubious title to you, since you has proven to me beyond a doubt that you qualify and probably surpass any other contestant in this competition. Maybe someday when you and Peter are happily married, you can look back on this whole episode without any bitterness. By the way, should I direct all my mail to Peter to you in the future? I wouldn’t want to commit some breach of protocol.
Oh, and I don’t hold any of this against you, Brian. I have enjoyed all of it immensely. Just remember, “we’re all kids, kids in an out-of-control world” — so why don’t we all just go wild so we can play along with the game?
       Lovingly, MJ
P.S. Please leave my friend out of this. What the hell makes you think that she had anything to do with my own decisions about my own relationships? At least I am capable of handling some things on my own.
P.P.S. I never condemned Tricia for her lifestyle. That is none of my business. It happens to stem from my hurt in the way she treated me.
P.P.P.S. I’m sorry, Peter, to treat you as the third person in something which is primarily your concern, but I felt like Brian stepped over the bounds of what even a friend is responsible for. And he made me damned amused. MJ

This is one of the most thorough (and well-deserved) take-downs I’ve had the pleasure/misfortune to experience.

Dear Brian Berns,
I think it’s time we had a serious talk. I’ve been wanting to ask you this for a long time – but, well, you know – it just kept getting put off. It’s better if I just say it straight out: Would you put lesbians in your wedding party? I mean, really, you can tell me the truth. I can take it. We are all mature adults here and we can deal with these things in a mature adult manner. You know?
Second item: I can hear it now: “Why the Hell is this girl writing me a letter? Why the Hell is this girl in Germany? Do they really wear knee socks in Germany and drink beer out of half-liter mugs?”
OK, my dear, let’s handle all this calmly. I’m in Germany, it’s true and right this very second I’m sitting in my kitchen in my little German apartment drinking diet Coke and breathing through my mouth. I hate breathing through my mouth. I have allergies you know. I just drank whiskey and coffee and I’m oh so bored. The truth is too that I have to finish a project for this semester, the outcome of which will decide whether or not I receive my 14 credit hours for the Oberlin German Studies Abroad Program. It was due almost 3 weeks ago but my professor (with whom I used to be madly in love, but now, you know) said I could just mail it to Oberlin so of course instead of finishing it I blew it off and went to Paris for a week. But sometime soon (tonight?) I do have to finish it. It’s already 15 pages long (in German) and only had to be 12 pages long. Prolificity will someday kill me.
Anyway, dearest, how’s life? How is it with that Peter Boy? I wrote him a postcard but now of course the 2 of you have to write me a letter because it is oh so lonesome not getting any fun mail here in Germany. Oh sadness. Did Peter decide where to go to school, or what? I’m dying to know. Does he still have that girlfriend with the weird name? Did you know that now I can actually go out with him and not get arrested for statutory rape? Oh joy.
I am really on drugs, I don’t know what the problem is. Did you hear Marcia is getting married? I hate being illegible but I think it’s a nervous condition and I should not be criticized for it. Got it? Here’s the news: I live in an apartment with another Melissa and another Peter, who are in love. Peter’s a student at Bayreuth University for law and he’s 29 and his father is the Oberbürgermeister. He sometimes brings us breakfast in bed and we all cook together. It all boils down to this: I get a bed to myself. Melissa and I lived together here for 2 months when our group from Oberlin was here. We’re taking 2 literature classes at the university and working and doing other exciting things like growing our nails long and taking pictures of rainbows. What a second, ok? I have to go blow my nose.
OK, I am back. Did I tell you about Paris? We drove there and hung out a lot, drank wine, met lots of Parisiens, etc. I of course met the Parisien love of my life. Unfortunately, we had few languages in common. C’est la vie. We’re going to write each other letters anyway and who knows, maybe someday we can marry our grandchildren off to each other. Wouldn’t that be grand?
Did I tell you I know Rocky Gay? Yes indeed, I met him right here in this very city. He says hi. Did I also tell you my mom went to California and wrote me 13 letters from there and each one contained identical information? Sometimes I wonder about her. Who knows what she really does there all alone in Reston. Maybe she rents erotic movies or plays “Bolero” while taking long bubble baths.
By the way, are you even at home? If not, then who is in reality reading this? Dear Brian, what are you going to do with your life? Tell me so maybe I can do it with mine, too. Or at least when people ask me I can just tell them it to make them happy. If they have questions, too, I can just give them your address.
OK, this illiteracy has got to end. Do you have a revolver handy or what?
I’m leaving now.
See ya,
Love, Missy (Melissa if asked)
P.S. In case we ever go on “The Newlyweds”: My favorite ice cream is mint chocolate chip.
P.P.S. My hair is completely neutral now!!

Dear Brian Berns,
It’s amazing how obnoxious yet endearing your letters can be – I really admire ambivalence in a fellow human. (I didn’t say “in a man” or “in a [?]” or even “in others” because you never know when some college student somewhere might puke). You realize I am only writing back to you because your letter bugged the shit out of me, (let me be honest here…) In fact, I don’t want you to think of this letter so as a reply to your letter as not…. that is, I have no thoughts on any matter. So let us concern ourselves with trivialities – such as the preferable aspects of words like dived vs. dove, dreamed vs. dreamt, etc. – Do you and your friends play fun word games, banter semantics, whoop it up, etc? Boy, Brown must be [a] fun place (just like Oberlin) too. – Or so Peter Fiori asseverates (and he would know). Holly is coming out to visit at the end of February. Along the same line, I get my wisdom teeth removed at the end of March. Hopefully at the end of the year I will have though of something to do with my life. I told my one friend how I was considering the Peace Corps and he laughed at me for an adequate period of time before explaining that “Go-Go’s don’t make it in the Peace Corps, in the wilderness or even behind desks” – I am crushed. I mean, who says that the South Yemenese don’t want discos that play Madonna and Prince and Elvis Costello? Boutiques with Playgirl and heart stationery? Raspberry schnapps, cherry Coke, cucumber earrings and glow-word socks? Life is hell without marijuana.
       Love M (M); yes, that’s “M”.

Dear Miss,
It's Friday today, and at about 8:00 pm we were watching TV, and my roommate Jeff decided that he wanted to go to a party that my roommate Evan and Evan's girlfriend Whitney, were going to go to. So, we waited a while, because that is the thing that you do before going to a party, and we were watching TV. Then my roommate Bob and his girlfriend Kristen decided to go to their party, which was a different one. So, Evan and Whitney decided, too, to go to their party, but sort of made it clear that they were going to go alone. The way they made this clear was by leaving without me and Jeff. Jeff was pretty angry, because everything Evan does fits exactly into the parts of Jeff that make him angry. Anyway, Whitney's Roommates are pretty good friends of ours (better friends with Jeff than me, I guess), and we knew that they were planning to go to the same party. So, Jeff called them up and they told him where the party was and told him that they were psyched that he wanted to go, too.
So, now Jeff and I are alone in our room, and we have to wait some more, because Whitney's Roommates were not going to go for awhile, and he didn't want to risk showing up at the party before they did. This is the good part. He played R.E.M. songs for me on our stereo and they were all so good, but I didn't admit it. I read the newspaper and Jeff picked out songs to play. Now, Jeff was really into the idea of going to this party and I wasn't so into it. Mainly, Jeff is lonely with all these girlfriends of other people around, and the running joke is that he and I need girlfriends pretty badly. So, he wanted to go to the party to get a girlfriend. All night, he had been talking me into going to the party with him, and though I wanted to stay home and write you a letter, I finally gave in. Part of the reason I gave in was that I was wearing my denim jacket that last year seemed really boring, but now was cool, because I was wearing it the way my sister Carolyn did, with her Commander Salamander buttons and everything. Mainly though, I liked being with Jeff, and I didn't want to let him down.
So, we left. I looked at myself in the mirror in the hallway on the way out, and though I can't say I looked good in the mirror, I was still pretty happy with the way I looked when I glanced down at my feet. Anyway, it was too late to turn back. We walked the few blocks to the party. We got to the street with the party and some of Jeff's friends were sitting in the doorway of this massive red brick building. It was dark and humid and they looked good in the doorway. One of them was black, and you almost couldn't see him at all. They had been to the party in question, and were discouraged because there were few women in attendance. They were waiting for more to show up before returning themselves. By this time, the idea of actually going into the house with the party seemed almost ridiculously silly to me. We walked further up the street toward the party. We passed the house with the party in it. There was music corning out of the house and the front door was open and you could see the small front part of the house with all the stairs going up and there was a shovel up against a wall. We saw no people. We continued walking, past the party. Jeff was still intending to go inside. But first he was building up his courage by trying to talk me into going in, too, because by this time I was violently against the idea.
Then, out of the darkness, this car veers off the road toward us. In the dark, as you know, a car doesn't look like a car, but just a pair of headlights. So, this pair of headlights pinned me to the sidewalk and someone inside the car was honking and it was pretty fucking annoying. Not only was it annoying, but it was Evan being annoying because it was his car and he was driving, and the car, it turned out, was full of Evan and Whitney and Whitney's Roommates (which made Jeff all the more angry, since it was obvious that Evan was willing to take Whitney's Roommates to the party, but not me and Jeff). And so we all headed back down the road to the party. I figured that Jeff's friends (the ones in the doorway) would now be able to return to the party, as women were now arriving in droves. (Whitney's Roommates number approximately six women.) Indeed, they were no longer in their doorway.
Well, even with the comfort of this shield of women friends. I didn't want to go in. Whitney put her arms around me, and dragged me to the party, and she didn't even pause when I told her that they had shovels against the wall in their front lobby. Interestingly, this fact didn't seem to bother Evan, either. It bothered no one but me. We went into the house. We climbed the stairs to the party. I told Whitney that the stairs were too steep, and that I would be outside guarding the car. It didn't work. We went into the party.
The first person I recognized inside the party was one of my roommates from last year, Lawrence. Lawrence is one of those guys that, if you are a girl, you have to at least consider sleeping with him. He's a cool guy, too, and I really like him a lot. But by this time, I was so uncomfortable that it was like I was on drugs, and what I told Lawrence was, "I'm certainly not surprised to you here.” The party was pretty standard, and I was wickedly uncomfortable. Evan got a drink. (Getting a drink consisted of forcing yourself between and around about twenty people with the idea of moving toward the part of the room with the highest concentration of people where the keg is invariably kept.) Evan got a drink. He brought it back. Jeff recognized a lot of people (he’s a very social guy, really). He started talking to this one girl who I had never seen before. Evan stood there with his beer, smirking at me, and, as time progressed, a pile of women accumulated between us, talking to each other. It was stupid. I was not happy. I told Evan that I was going to go downstairs and guard his car. I told Jeff that I was going to go downstairs and guard Evan's car. I went downstairs to guard the car.
I became very impulsive. Logically, I became aware that there was no way to guard a car without cigarettes. I walked to a store and bought some cigarettes. I lit a cigarette. My blood was pumping. I was ready to guard the car.
I walked back to the car. The idea was that I was going to sit on the car, and with my cigarette and my cool attitude protect the car from the weather and the people walking around and from Acts of God. I arrived at the car; it was wet from rain. I thought about sitting on the hood, but it occurred to me that normal people (i.e. people more content with their lives than me) do not sit on wet car hoods. Anyway, the hood of the car sloped in a way that made it impossible to sit on. I walked around to the trunk of the car (which was considerably more square and easier to sit on) and decided to use my denim jacket to wipe some of the rain away from the area where I was going to sit. So, I gathered the shirttail of my denim jacket into a ball and in one motion, wiped an ass-sized chunk of car trunk free of rain. The rain from the car splooshed through the air. It splooshed right into my cigarette. This wasn’t a good sign. I lit a new one, and sat down.
Shortly, it became obvious that there was no way to guard a car by sitting on its back. Really, you just have to face front, because it's just silliness to think that you can guard something from the back of it. I had the look of a guy who was sitting on the back of a car, and though that is a fine look (sometimes), it just wasn't cutting it. So, I moved to the front of the car. I was enjoying the challenge. It was life at its Best. Now, as I said, the front was just too sloped and modern looking to allow actual full-butt sitting. What I did, instead, was just sort of lean there against the front of the car, and cross my legs at the ankles. My cigarette hand was dangling well. The shoes looked good, together there at the bottom of my legs. It seemed to be working pretty good, and so I felt ready to start to concentrate on the cigarette smoking aspects of my duty.
So, after I had had about three cigarettes in a row I noticed that this car-guarding stuff was more difficult than it first appeared. The thought of another cigarette was pretty appalling, but I went for it anyway, because that is the attitude that you have to have when you are guarding a car. I knew, though, that my time was almost up. By now, the car was about as guarded as I could make it, and any further guarding on my part would probably have been simply a waste of lung power. Jeff, Evan, Whitney, and The Roommates were still inside at the party. I had to give up on them when a group of people stumbled out the door in my direction. They were carrying bottles and all had their arms around each other. Basically, they blew my car-guarding look clear out of the water with their good cheer. I was pretty devastated. I had to leave. But it was OK, because I had intended all along to put all this in a letter to you, and this gave me a good chance to do it. I lit a parting cigarette and headed home. __________ 
Etc. etc... I got home. I wrote the first part of this letter. It was fun. Now, it's the 11th. So, it’s taken me about a week to complete it. I want to make it clear to you that although this letter certainly isn't my standard straight-ahead deal, it is in no way a gibe at you. I just went to the party with the intention of telling you what happened, and I did it. Hope it wasn't too boring.
Straight-ahead part of the letter : Sorry I didn't see you there at the end of the summer. Believe me, I would've loved to, but the idea of participating in yet another Fiori-orchestrated ordeal was a little too much for me. I'm sure he told you all about our current fight. Plus, he had made the comment a few days earlier that he thought that you and I were friends mainly because you and he were friends. I didn't want to deal with that possibility. Write me back.
love,
Brian

The (in)famous party letter. I wish I had left out the disclaimer near the end (“I want to make it clear…”), since it had the opposite of its intended effect.

Tuesday Sept 30
Dear Brian –
I kept not writing you in order to finally make a wonderful letter and send it. My horoscope informed me that it never happened until 1998 – so I did it now. TODAY is my boring day. Please bear with this.
I sent your letter to the New Yorker and they’re publishing it. Thanks. The only part I didn’t like was the Peter Fiori aphorism (sic [?]) at the end. What was the context for this statement? How is he doing at school, anyway? Do you hear from him?
My housemate is committing art in the kitchen – she uses this terminology much in the same way one would say “commit suicide.”
I am sort of sick of school but sort of loving it. I keep not doing work. In fact even as we speak I am skipping one class – Beginning Danish. I even like this class, but, you know, it rained.
I was sad at the end of the summer that we couldn’t get together. I really wanted to see you. Holly and I both, in fact. Yeah yeah that’s the ticket. We are right now listening to Elvis Costello “Imperial Bedroom.” My housemate (for the sake of simplicity let’s just call her “Susan” from now on, ok?) ANYWAY, “Susan” just told me that in Italy last year she read an article about Elvis Costello where he said he got a new girlfriend, but he missed his old one, and that he changed his name back to what it was, which was something like “McGinnis.” What do you think of this?
Now I’m back. It keeps raining here. Am I going to see you in December? In October I am going to California. You know, the thing that makes me sad is that I read your whole letter in absolute joy until I got to the last page where you stated that it was not a jibe at me or anything, etc. because I hadn’t thought anything like that but then I started thinking (as per usual): What is he trying to SAY with this? Is he being sincere or sarcastic? Does he hate me, did he send 8 copies of this letter to all his friends (and Esquire magazine)? Don’t really [sic] I don’t really think any of it. I do, however, get a little nervous when I sit to start a letter to you. I’ll try not to talk about my bed, my walls, or my spray starch.
I’m going to see “Aliens” tonight and then I’m eating delicious chocolate birthday cake that Beth McKee’s mother, from Wayne, Maine, sent her. I decided to be an elementary school teacher when I grow up. By the way my two friends “Susan” and “Susannah” read your letter as well and both want to ask where to apply for this “girlfriend” position. Susannah is the best one for parties, but mopey, whereas “Susan” is pathological but has nice calves.
I went on a road trip to Niagara Falls this weekend, and Chautauqua N.Y. and was in Canada for the first time. It was excellent but we couldn’t “see” the Falls – in so many words. We got wet. Do I get the job?
       Love Melissa (Miss)

November 1986 – From Melissa
Dear Brian Berns,
This used to be a party invitation, by the way. I got your letter last night when I was getting back from break. Just think, it sat in my mailbox within inches of and possibly touching a letter from Peter Fiori in Wooster, Ohio. I am sorry to hear about the divorce – hopefully not quite so permanent, rather more of a separation, I hope? I can’t believe this would be permanent for you two. The same thing actually happened to Holly and me – we weren’t friends for an entire year and then we reunited. (Do you know this story? This was the same period that you and I had the letter wars and Peter and I weren’t speaking and all of Lewinsville Fellowship was buzzing with news of “the abortion.” Not fun.) ANYWAY – wow, I was really surprised to get the letter from Peter because I hadn’t written him or anything. It’s possible we’ll get together. He’s only 45 minutes from here.
This is something I wasn’t going to say because I thought I didn’t have to say it, Brian sweetheart. But when I read your wonderful party letter and I got to the end and you had written the part about “not wanting to deal with the possibility” of you and me just being friends through Peter, I thought what an amazing thing for Peter to say or suggest [or] even think about. I thought, how ironic because judging from my last contact with Peter and Brian together, it was Brian that I really was psyched to see and Peter I felt uncomfortable around. Of course we became friends because of Peter – but my former passion for him has turned into a curious alienation. I don’t understand him at all – not that I understand or know you. Do I? You probably weren’t asking to hear all this. But to be truthful (and I think I am being truthful) – remember our long conversations on the mushrooms-night we three spent in Maryland [sic] in the park and on the astroturf? Remember Pete got upset and I think walked away and I made some stupid wondering comment and you said “Oh come on, Miss, it’s obvious” or “It’s obvious he cares about you” or something. And you would not believe that that had not occurred to me or wasn’t continually, painfully obvious to me. In fact, this baffled me. Not that it was the problem, but that it was so big and so still a problem. Maybe I’m just being insensitive and not thoughtful enough, but I just can’t and couldn’t understand why now, after so much time, Peter could not seem to communicate with me. I mean, of course I can understand people being insecure. The point of all this is the big blockade it put/puts on my relationship to him. I can just not consider him my friend because of this – he’s a former boyfriend. Brian, I consider you a friend – I am interested in what you think, I like to spend time with you, and I care (if not worry) about what you think of me. Besides this, you write the best letters and you challenge me without my wanting to die or to strangle you. Oh, by the way, do you think you could loan me $10,000?
Bored as usual, I sit in “Chinese Thought and Religion” listening to a long and detailed explication of 3 modern Chinese talismans against blindness, pregnancy and death at sea. It’s so true – I am tired of school or academics or something. Actually I like being at school and the social life and this year I’ve met a new group of people whom I like a lot and love to hang out with – also I’ve become good friends with my housemate – who before was a “mutual friend” and “a nice girl.” Now we spend a lot of time together. BUT – it’s gotten to the point with me that I only do well in these aspects of my life that I care about – and everything else I just let go. This is not a good plan. I do not recommend it. You want those fun job offers, right? Tell me – do you have a blue pin-striped interview power-suit? I had one interview, actually. It was ok. I don’t want a job. I want to buy an old ’57 Chevy and a tape deck and a huge icebox full of drinks and a Polaroid camera and I want to drive across the country, out west. Want to come? I will write a great collection of short stories and it will not in the least […]

Sadly, the end of this letter was lost before I ever read it.

1987
January 26, 1987 – From Melissa
Dear Brian Berns,
Sorry about the boring paper. Of course I just got your letter of epic proportions. It was wonderful. I still mourn often for the end of my wonderful letter which you seem never to have received. There is always the distant hope that some good soul will send you the latter pages – after having tracked you down through the contents. Maybe it would be better if this were not to happen. Still…. The news of the day: I was supposed to get my passport-sized picture taken (and buy 4 copies at $9 a pair – they think I am made of ivory) but I didn’t because I found out it could cost less if I had a certain coupon which I may still have. It is, you know, that kind of coupon which all students receive during the first week classes in the fall and which only fresh-people ever really attempt to use. We veterans of academia prefer to stuff it in a drawer until May – or better yet, to toss it. ANYWAY – all this disappointment even after I put on my power blue outfit. (The pictures are to send to the Fulbright commission, who will send them to German Institutions of learning, who will decide if I am fit to mold the minds of the German youth. So I thought the blue appropriate – a catchy color, with personality, not passive, but not too flamboyant, not unauthoritative, not extravagant or unlikable. – You see, I passed the first selection of the Fulbright process – now I have to wait until May or even June to hear the final word. This part sucks.)
The rest of the day included: teaching four thrilling students about the thrilling qualities of German relative pronouns; then eating Ramen for lunch while watching All My Children on T.V. and preparing my lesson for tomorrow’s class; then pricing textbooks at the Co-op bookstore. Then I made drinking plans for this evening with my girl – Susannah. I had to tell you all this so you would know where I’m coming from, you know.
There were some things I was just dying to tell you after your letter. (1) That as of 3 weeks ago I was a stranger to the joys of Suzanne Vega, but now not only do I follow a steady diet of her album but I’m also learning to play the guitar and mostly only play songs of hers as yet – like “Cracking,” “Queen and the Soldier,” “Small Blue Thing”. She almost came to Oberlin but we couldn’t afford her – alas. (2) I didn’t read Bright Lights, Big City, but maybe I will (3) Maybe there really is no book called Slaves – who knows (4) I never considered being an intellectual hero before – but now that you mention, it’s a hot idea. Today at the co-op I saw a book I wanted to read called Hero with a Thousand Faces – I think it was about the concept of the hero through the ages, in literature, etc.
(5) I took mushrooms the other night and ended up a sobbing, hysterical, almost-hyperkinetic, mess of paranoia. My advice to you: never mix your illicit medicines.
(6) Maybe someday the “trip out west” can really happen – don’t they give Watson’s or something for “pictorial narratives” on the subject of “Americana?” – you could get the application forms – I’ll buy an ice chest and polaroid film…
(7) My dad worked for NSA (then ASA) his whole life – he spoke Chinese. We lived in Taiwan and Okinawa (where I was born), and then Ethiopia (for two years immediately before Haile lost it) – you’ll like this part: my dad was an army colonial [?], the commander of Kagnew Station in Asmara, Ethiopia – at that time the only American government monitoring/communications/spy-outpost in Africa – if you’ve got your heart set on putting your eye to keyholes for Uncle Sam, just tell them you know me. I am Miss Army Brat 1964-1972 (the prime years).
(8) Today I got offered a job – the kind you do at school to make money to pay to eat – for 20 hours a week – this makes me happy, but if you like, you can immediately eradicate it from your brain. My humblest apologies. At your service, Melissa Jones
OK, so that was a fake ending to this letter, this impressive collection of arbitrary, unrelated thoughts and desires which compose my persona. – This reminds me, isn’t “1987” a hell of a lot more fun to write than “1986”? – And, as well, isn’t orange a color which, regretfully, very few of us can get away with wearing.
The Last Page
It snows and snows here, and I haven’t been to any good parties lately. Have you? Or should I ask…. I am sorry to hear about the non-completion of your Peter Fiori “making-up” attempts. It’s altogether possible that midlife crisis will be your next shot at reconciliation. Don’t let this depress you, please. It was certainly not meant in this spirit. Besides – you still have me. Unfortunately, Holly and I had a “tiff” (the only appropriate word for what it was) concerning something I guess I shouldn’t have said in front of Beth but which didn’t seem to be that big of a deal, especially since Beth didn’t even catch it – but which made me feel like shit. I wrote her a nice long letter since, but no word. Soon she goes off into the wilds of the East Coast, too. I hate ending like this,
Love Miss











February 3, 1987 – From Brian


I started having trouble writing you honestly, so I sent this dumb letter instead. Sorry about that.
Summer 1987 #1 – From Melissa
 


I think this card was for my going-away party after graduating from Brown.




Summer 1987 #2 – From Melissa
Dear Brian (Boston division),
Oh where to begin, where to begin? It seems as if one million things have happened in the last few days, whereas for weeks before that life was one long long Sunday. You may be happy to hear that this is the first of a series of letters brought to you by Masterpiece Theater and your local public T.V. network – each one finely crafted and signed by the artist. Invaluable and inestimable collectors’ items, each and every one of them. Let me also not fail to add that the splinter in my finger became sick and died, so that writing is now a difficult and ungraceful activity for me. But I think survival is in the stars.
Do you know that I started to miss you before you had even left, especially at your party – that fun gala affair that it was. You were busy and distracted of course, but it also seemed that you had to take extra care not to really talk to me. And at the bar, too. It all made me so sad – for one thing, your leaving; another, that I was just getting to be your friend and there was all this strife surrounding it; but also not getting to really talk to you at the end. You have to excuse my irritating curiosity, too – I wonder what Peter had said to you Friday night. You said he yelled at you at 2 A.M. and I really was surprised, because he’d been perfectly normal to me on the phone. I had almost gone out and done something with him and his friends that very evening. Why do I always feel like I never know what’s going on? I want to grow up and be in the know like you are, Brian. Where do I take classes?
I thought your friends were wonderful. They didn’t make me feel paranoid either – so I was being really obnoxious to them. They were fun. I never talked to Evan until the evening, though; and then when we were playing cards he kept cracking me up. He had the most wonderful expressions, and his whole attitude about the game was great. Usually I hate meeting people – friends of friends especially, because you feel as if you’re not allowed to blow them off as you would with strangers if they didn’t strike you the right way. Alex was really easy to talk to – how come you never said anything about him before? And I don’t think you are even allowed to have a cousin your same age with whom can actually be seen in public without dying of embarrassment. Yes, I am sure you are breaking some law here.
Monday I was restless and had nothing to do with myself – then the mail came and I was excited because a thick letter from my friend Beth McKee was with it. I opened it and it was a xeroxed letter, also sent to my other 2 housemates, and a xerox of all 3 pages of the phone bill. She didn’t even sign her name in real pen. I owed the least: $7:41. My one claim to glory the last semester at school: every month I won the Lowest Phone Bill of the Month Award. Unfortunately, virtue is its own reward in this case.
I reread your party letter, I’ll xerox it for you too sometime. I realized that whenever you smoke it reminds me of how you described it in that letter. You get no explanation of this. Lately I keep craving cigarettes more and more. I rest content with the fact that I’ll never go so far as to buy my own pack. I would be too embarrassed to ask for them. There must be some inside lingo involved of which I cannot conceive. What if I said, “Could I have a pack of Camel Lights, please”? And it turned out that only thirteen-year-old geeky non-initiates say that – that’s how they spot them. The 7-11 guy would say to me, “Does your mommy know you’re smoking?” Even if he just smirked – it would devastate me.
I think I have that blur in the brain that flies by and is gone.
You know, now I’ve reread a ton of your old letters – including the Hell Letters. Even after all these years, they still had the power to make me wince. And I don’t even have any idea any more of what I’d written to you – a vague idea only, I mean. Some of it was evident through your citations and “sics.” Do you still have mine? Someday I’d like to see them.
Now I am watching Johnny Carson interview 4 Playboy bunnies. They are special. One said her turnoffs included men who think they’re stupid, “because we’re not. Just because I’m wearing these ears.” Two of the bunnies moonlight as Los Angeles Raiderettes. One is bouncy, long-blond-curled-haired, and is from London. She is my personal favorite. Unfortunately, she’s also on cocaine. But it’s ok – I don’t mind a nice girl on drugs.
Now there is Ed Kennedy – yes, that’s right – Ed “If I can lift it, I can balance it” Kennedy. He is balancing a card table on his chin. (It suddenly occurred to me that you could be watching this very show. What a tragic waste of a young life that would be. One thing you don’t have, however – and I must attest to its perfect complement to the situation – is my mother gently snoring on the couch behind me. Which reminds me – my mother was telling me how pleased she was about you thanking her and chatting at the end of the banquet. So I said – “Well I heard that he thanked you and you said, ‘So how much are you going to contribute?’” And she said, “I was just kidding.” You see, my mom can be as difficult as me. Faulty memory, a murky and clouded sensibility.)
       [Mustn’t forget this → ) ]
You didn’t believe it until now – life is one long digression. A Nuprin commercial was on T.V. – my ex-roommate Carin – a true art girl and recipient of Heaviest Earrings Honorary title – just gave up her job at a film development place to work for a corporation that makes up names for products. The company’s claim to fame is that they invented “Nuprin”. The word, not the product.
        What if  -	Buddha wore braces?
       		Your mom started the Chinese Cultural Revolution?
       		Babies were born in plaid suits?
Brian, you word rebel, you’re in Letter Heaven. But how will I ever send it to you? It goes against all I believe in to give people letters in person. The best part is stamping, addressing and mailing – or if you’re on the other end of the deal; opening the mail box and holding and unopened, thick envelope with your name on it.
So this is doomed never to be the “Hannah and Her Sisters” of the Letter Kingdom. What the heck, I can deal.
Do you know, Peter Fiori actually expressed a limited sort of anger (or something) towards me. He drove me home from your house Sunday and didn’t speak a word to me the way home. He hummed to himself. And when I got out he sort of said goodbye to me matter-of-factly, and the he sped off. I cried myself to sleep.
Oops – sorry.  Faux pas  – this is where computers come in handy. I keep yelling at my pen but it refuses to swallow any delete orders. I would give anything – even my personalized collection of Franz Kafka’s letters to his fiancée – to see those forever lost, cruelly discarded portions of letters to me. You letter-butcher. (Did you hear about those Kafka letters, though? The guy who owns Domino’s Pizza and some baseball team bought them for circa $600,000. The highest price ever for literary originals, or some such thing. I can picture him now in some darkened room, fondling them and weeping copiously.
Did you see “Peggy Sue Got Married?” The quote is from that – you could probably figure it out if you saw the movie.
As we are winding down, it is now time for some closing thoughts.
1. This letter rather sacrifices quality for quantity. It’s the result of talking around things.
2. I hate T.V. more than it hates me.
3. It was rather fun seeing ourselves on film, wasn’t it?
4. If you find any articles in papers and magazines that are well-written, not too dense, and would be relevant in painting some perspective of America to German youth – clip them for me. On any subject.
5. I thought your father was wonderful.
6. Go see “Twist and Shout.”
I’m sorry – 7 has been cancelled due to undesirable audience response. I hate that.
8. To return to the old theme – aren’t you game to try the joys of unedited letter-writing. You’d be better write me, too. I can even arrange for you to take Letter Mailing 101 if it will help. Or a support group could be created. You are not in this alone. Never forget that. Get ‘long, buckaroo.
9. I reread millions of old letters from everyone who ever deemed it wise and/or pleasurable to write to me. All this was done in the midst of violent room-cleaning and life-organization. In one (of the letters), Marcia said you’d “become even more cynical since going to college – if that’s possible.” In another one, you told me if I wrote one more letter to you “devoid of feeling” you would “hunt (me) down and kill (me).” In yet another letter, Peter told me if he could pick one person not to die in the event of nuclear holocaust, it would be me. (Not that that would be an altogether desirable state of being). The very best, most Marcia-like quote was in a long, talky letter of hers to me. She said she hoped you got a girlfriend and got “it” before going to college. She was “confused about the whole thing” and “needed (your) thoughts and opinions on the matter.” In this same letter she also talked at length about Princess Diana.
(I can’t believe I got into another page, when I had already started my closing statements and everything. What must you think of me. Well, now for the questions.)
Do you like Boston? How well do you know Boston? Why did you choose to live in Boston? Whatever you do, don’t take a house on Liberty Ave in Somerville. How close are you to Evan? Are you (A) O.K. together (B) good friends (C) staunch conservatives (D) infatuated (E) young at heart (F) good at a party (G) choose your own? Are you good friends with Alex, too? Whatever happened to Bill? Do you know any other people in Boston? How often do you plan to come to Virginia? Who were these unintroduced Brown girls at your party, and do they have any vital statistics? Are you planning to cook? Do you know how to cook? What is Evan’s job? Wouldn’t it be great if it turned out Nancy Reagan had been addicted to something innocuous like breakfast cereals, car ashtrays, or sweatsocks for years? If the night belongs to Michelob, who does the day belong to? Sara Lee?
A SUNNY DAY at the POOL with Melissa.
Unforeseen occurrences (left my dictionary at home) dictate that you shall receive a short stay on the pending conclusion of your letter. By chance your letter came to the pool with me. But then active acknowledgement of opportunity took the place of blind chance. (A sentence with the power to induce vomiting in a long-dead George Orwell). (And I even corrected it in order to bring it to this state). ANYWAY, I just had to tell you about how just minutes after I recognized the soundtrack to “Flashdance” on someone’s box to the left of me, I looked over and identified the owner of said “music.” She is magazine-thin, wears a teal blue two-piece bathing suit, pink plastic earrings, and has fastened her permed blond locks into a plastic hair clip. – You protest my presentation of this unfortunate stereotype? Don’t be so critical, sweetheart. Stereotypes live and breath like the rest of us. She was busy spreading baby oil on her lithe body, too.
INTERESTING NEWS FLASH:
Marcia wrote me a 2½ page letter on the computer. I was impressed. It renewed my faith in childhood friendships and all the things that she was connected with in my “youth.” She said she still felt close to me and wished we could have talked more. She talked about how much she missed Greg after being away at the beach and how scared that made her about next year. No news about anyone else.
I’m really psyched about coming to Boston but you will probably be seeing me being psyched in the flesh by the time you get this. I’m riding up (from Philadelphia) with Sanjaya, who lives in Bethesda. Then we’re driving from there to Boston. Me, Sanjaya, Eric and Dan. Sanjaya is hilarious. I could not begin to describe in what ways. Dan is the classic Latin playboy, Oberlin division (he has maybe 1, maybe 2 years before he graduates). His father is the one who fought Castro. And he used to live next door to “Ernesto” Hemingway, in Spain. They used to fish together.
I finished reading this book, The Beans of Egypt, Maine. It is a good example of that kind of book you are glad to say you have read – and you have actually read it – but which brings no pleasure in reading, or afterwards. It illustrated one thing for me – rural poverty and family life under it – but I do not feel broadened. I am also still reading through Invisible Cities. (I have been reading it off-and-on for about 1½ years.) Theoretically I love it. But I find it hard to concentrate on, and can read only one chapter per day. Definitely not poolside reading.
Oh no, this is the end! And so sudden too.
Love Melissa

Hello Milk of Magnesia –
I thought for awhile I had the black star of Euswamie branded on my forehead, I got so little mail from you. But I understand – you’re a young man trying to do your best in the world. ANYWAY, I’ve been busy too. I was at the beach for a whole week. Also, I’ve done a little coverage of the Iran-Contra hearings for The Nation – only as a temporary thing, mind you. After that, I began following the Dead all over America on their tour. I now am the proud owner of 337 tie-dyed t-shirts. I have fathered love children to 50 chicks.
So now to the important apartment talk: do you have a T.V.? I hope your job search is going well. If you have bad luck getting a job, you can blame it on me, however. Erik Booth lost his job and he blames it on me so I’ve decided in general to take the sins of the world upon myself. Mankind will seem ungrateful for a little while, but I believe that soon it will come to see the error of its ways. (Erik Booth is still sending me hate mail.) What is your apartment like? No, really – I do want to know. How far is Brighton from Boston – will you still try to work in Boston? Do you worry about the fact that you’ll have to miss David Letterman once you grow up? Or will you just record it on the VCR and watch it during breakfast?
Now for the girl talk, etc. Have you heard of this new movie, “Can’t Buy Me Love”? I saw a commercial for it on T.V. and it looks like just the dumb bad good kind of movie I need to get me out of the depths of Angst. (I’m not really in the depths of Angst anymore. Summer in Reston eventually evens all that out of you. So everything is OK with me except I’m being nasty and cruel to my mother. She has been driving me crazy and I am not even sure why. I’ll feel guilty after I go. I am watching Saturday Night Live reruns on T.V. right now with Paul Simon in a turkey outfit. Now he’s singing “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.” He has a beautiful guitar.)
ANYWAY, I’m leaving in less than 2 weeks although I don’t know exactly when because I don’t have my plane ticket yet. I do know my address, which I will, of course, enclose. Never fear. To lose the precious opportunity of writing to me – that would be too much, wouldn’t it? I hope your roommate is mending. Did he go home? Are you going to come to VA – maybe next week so I can see you? We could go to the 9:30 Club and see some concert and drink $2.00 cans of Jolt. Maybe if we really wanted to do it up we could get our car towed.
I liked your letter but it just ended – I don’t know what I expected. I guess you were distracted. (Me, I’m distracted right now. Headache, beer, T.V., late night, trouble, etc.)
My address: 	“Frau” Melissa Jones
     Bei Jager
     6640 Merzig
     Klinkerstr. 82
     W. Germany
I want to mail you this now so you get no more pardon from the ever-onward marching progress of your daily existence. OK? Please write me here soon, or there sometime soon. Take care,
Love your friend Melissa Jones.



This seems to have been written in response to a letter from me that I don’t have a copy of.
My roommate Evan’s girlfriend had just broken up with him, and he went home to recover while I moved into our new apartment in Boston by myself. Then, before starting my new job, I returned briefly to VA, where you were busy preparing for a year in Germany.





 
September 7, 1987 – From Melissa
Hello Brian Berns, Bostonite of the week.
I guess by now you will have guessed that I am no longer on the continent of North America, so your mother doesn’t have to worry about me breaking anything more in her house. I am, in fact, in Germany, in the Saarland, to be more specific, in a town called Merzig; in fact, in a little house that sits on the border of Merzig and Brotdorf, 2 miles from the center of things. (Erich Honecker is from the Saarland.) I have a little apartment (about 1/3 of the upper floor of the house). This consists of my bedroom, complete with slanted roof, nice view of distant hills, houses, fields, trees; blue patterned wallpaper, and a mini-kitchen. It’s actually a full kitchen but everything in it is so small that you have to think of it in the diminutive. I am sitting at my desk. Right now I am basking in the glow of my just-purchased little lamp. I will say hi for you.
So, now that you know about my surroundings, let me add that I have been here since the 20th of August. I came to Merzig first, met my landlords (an exceptionally nice old couple), then I set out to see all of Germany in the week and 1/2 I had until my orientation for the teaching assistantship (which was 30th-3rd). It didn’t turn out quite as I had expected. I had pictured myself free and independent, young and full of energy, striding about the thoroughfares of great cities and striking landscapes alike, eyes open, heart pound, aesthetic sensibilities in full thrust. I thought of Goethe and other greats who said that you become only in travel, etc, etc. It turned out I felt homesick and alone and sure the one year was the whole rest of my sad, uninteresting life. I wanted to use that plane ticket to fly back to Dulles or even to Boston, or Philadelphia, or NY. Everything seemed awful. But you’ve probably guessed that it is again going much better. I met up with friends in travelling; I stayed with some friends of our family in Heidelberg. I “did Munich” with 2 Oberlin people. By the time I got to the orientation I felt halfway valid again.
At the orientation, I am happy to report, it came to me with some finality that at the end of this year, I have no desire/intention of becoming a teacher. What a relief. In our group of Americans (30 teaching assistants in Germany) maybe 1/2 are doing this as a stepping-stone experience in their teaching careers. Some are already certified. I was relieved to ask some people if they were among that group and be answered “NO WAY.” Although right now I am half wishing I had the experience and expertise of some of the almost-teachers, I am able to look at this year as a once-in-a-lifetime thing. That makes it feel unique, significant, special. You see, I keep having to talk myself into being pleased about these things. I have been cajoling myself into acceptance for 2 weeks now.
The thing I feel the most positive about is becoming really fluent in German. That is one of my main goals (among the others are: deciding what to do next, reading a lot, learning how to draw, getting really good at the guitar, writing a ton, taking some really interesting classes at the University. I did, by the way, get accepted to the University of Saarbrücken. I want to take some art history and literature classes. Maybe Italian too. Saarbrücken is about 20 or 30 minutes away by train.) I am thinking I could do some translating when I get back, to make money. I would like to get a job that has anything to do with writing, for instance, even copy editing or copy writing or writing obituary notices for some small town newspaper with a circulation of 50.
I hate when you’re trying to write a good letter and you suddenly find yourself talking about jobs, careers, school, etc. Sorry about that.
Today I went to the school for the first time (it was the first day of school as well). It was sort of overwhelming. The kids had already left by the time I got there, because classes aren’t arranged yet or anything. I met my “mentor” teacher, an English teacher, who’ll sort of be in charge of me in my inexperience and naïveté. The director of the school (principle) told me I will be teaching 12 hours per week: 6 hours Advanced English course (only working with the normal teacher) and 6 hours conversation. They said they don’t want me teaching any beginner or intermediate-level classes because, being an American, I may only confuse them. Isn’t that hilarious? Of course they are taught British in the schools (and are quite snobby about it); they feel that an American influence might taint their grasp of the language. After the director said that, he hastened to add – “but, of course, from the way you speak, that wouldn’t really have been a problem. Nevertheless…” I don’t mind. Who wants to teach 11 through 15 year olds? I will dazzle them with my flawless, melodious English nonetheless, and they will be infinitely sorry that their children missed out.
I was vaguely introduced to the faculty, and then attended a faculty meeting at which it was point out that “Frau Jones comes to us from Virginia, near Washington, D.C.” – oohs and ahhs at the mention of Virginia. Everyone in Germany knows where Virginia is; the Midwest States don’t fare so well, alas for them. The teachers were all very nice. One of the English teachers is very young and told me straight off I could say “du” to him instead of the formal “Sie.” I was glad. It is horrible to be 23 and addressed as if you are 60. (Germany in general is hard for an American to get used to: neighbors who wen tot Elementary School together usually still say “Sie” and call each other by their last names. It drives me crazy!) Anyway, I didn’t stay long. I go back tomorrow to sort of have a meeting with the teachers I’ll work with.
I imagine that you’ve started your job by now. Do you have the kind of colleagues that throw parties all day Friday, and who go out dancing? Does anyone? Isn’t it weird to think that school is starting back in old Oberlin and Providence? Do you care? I do – I was there for 5 years. I don’t really miss it. I just think of it nostalgically. Basking in a rosy youthful sentimentality, or something like that.
Now the sun just came out. The saddest news I read is that the Smiths broke up. How could you let this happen? Books of the month (that you should read, according to me):
Anything by Milan Kundera
That’s all I can think of right now. I had to switch pens – that one was acting as mild irritant. I gave my friend Susannah all your data, so maybe she’ll call you. But then again, maybe she won’t. I think she said she might not be able to just call someone up she didn’t know very well. She lives in Somerville. Do you have my address:
Melissa Jones
bei JAGER
Klinkerstr 82
6640 Merzig
W. Germany

(see enclosed phone brochure)
01149-06861-6862
ask for “Melissa”

How is your roommate doing? Maybe you should introduce him to Susannah (if she calls you) – she likes redheads with witty humors. (Am I being coarse? Sorry – it’s because I’m going an inappropriately long period of time without mail from you.) Maybe I’ll give you Susannah’s number – no pressure, you understand.
Susannah Mooney
68 Liberty Ave
Somerville, MASS. 02144
617-623-0414
If you call her, don’t ask for Erik – the horrible Erik Booth, destroyer of my self-confidence, is her housemate.
I lost 10 lbs from not eating – also I now walk 2 miles into town at least once, sometimes twice, a day. The school must be 1 mile or so. I look the same though – just ask anyone.
Did you really have a good time with me and Eric (and Beth (and Kristia))? Or were you only saying you liked Eric to please me (how can you answer that?) He is fun, though, isn’t he?
If you write me I will be not only most eternally grateful but I will also write you with more and more exciting tidbits of my life. What an offer. Do write! Send news.
       Love, Miss (Melissa in the civilized world.)











September 1987 – From Melissa

 


Yes, I was finally turning 21.


October 13, 1987 – From Melissa
* Written sometime at the beginning of the Age of Aquarius.
Dear Brian Berns,
I decided to write you and tell you how mean you’re being for not writing me just because I didn’t call to say goodbye when I was running all over Northern Virginia trying to mail off 6 steamer trunks and various hat boxes to Germany and making last minute trips to Hechingers to buy absolutely vital things like adapters and travel irons and all of my aunts and cousins and sisters kept calling me to say goodbye and to get in a good reference to some luscious only-to-be-purchased-in-Germany Christmas gift which I would remember to send if I happened to see it. But before I say that, let me voice the hope that you don’t have any such intention in remaining so vastly silent at all. Maybe, for instance, you broke your computer and it has been so long that the two of you have been as one that the idea of composing a letter alone, with just the use of your two hands and a writing utensil (such as a pen), that you are now to be officially considered a disabled person. Maybe that is it. If so, please accept my condolences. And my address:
Melissa Jones bei Jager
Klinkerstr 82
6640 Merzig West Germany
Or maybe you are utilizing this golden opportunity to avenge yourself upon me for having neglected you in the spring (so you said) – you are chuckling to yourself picturing me camped out by the mailbox overnight, hoping to waylay the mailman and force him into handing over the precious letter from Brighton? (Which I imagine he might keep for himself, to line his bird cage with or something) Or maybe you have called a truce with Peter Fiori, the terms of which stipulate nonconditional relinquishment of any contact with me. Or maybe you did write letters but decided to save money and send them by surface mail. WHICH IS IT?
Now that I’ve got that all out of my system, I can start a real letter. Let me begin with small talk: how are you? I am fine.
OK, so I am not really “fine,” in the strict sense of the word. I am sort of hovering between “restless,” “depressed,” “irritated,” “bored,” “alone,” “useless,” “lazy,” “self-deprecating.” You know, typical me. Except it is more desolate to be all of the familiar things in a distant, alien place. I go through phases. Sometimes I am very happy to be in this environment, and to be doing what I am doing. Other times I get really freaked out by the idea that I came here to lead discussion sections of 17 year olds who were born within 15 miles of their school and in their spare time “like to listen to music.” What kind of music? “Oh, the music that plays on the radio.” I never realized a whole reality could exist within the word “provincial.”
Just recently I started doing things with people I’ve met spontaneously, i.e. mostly students. They go to high school one year longer than we do in the States, so the highest class are 18 or 19, sometimes 20, years old. Some of them seem about my age – act it – and have “formed characters” (i.e. as compared to the younger ones, they have ideas, some questions, a vague “wholeness” to their personalities (does this develop suddenly at age 17 or something? I have never noticed it before.) I just feel like I’ve done more than they have (sort of a scary thought. I can’t believe I’m 23. I keep wanting to lie and at least amend it to 22.) But since I’ve had one or two “fun” experiences of going out, in comparison, the return to being alone, having time on my hands which I feel the responsibility to kill in constructive ways, is that much the worse. More depressing. For instance, today: a perfectly good, long stretching Saturday. I went to school, I bought a few groceries, I got back to my house by 1:30 or so. And then I realized I had the whole day stretching endlessly before me, with no plan and no desire to be alone to read or be otherwise constructive. And the whole town closes down at 1 P.M.
I am painting a grim picture, I imagine. I’m sure I already have in previous letters? Anyway, last weekend was fun – the Oktoberfest and Viezfest (pronounced “Feets”). Viez is apple wine. Basically the whole center of town was packed with stalls, little stages of German bands, and people people people, mainly drunk. It was fun to see some life, activity and chaos. I hung out with basically 1 set of students – Oliver, his friend Axel, and Oliver’s girlfriend Dorothée. Axel I know the best at this point. He plays guitar very well. We played together twice and he taught me lots of stuff. He is wholeheartedly into Suzanne Vega (I’ve met many who are! English, French, and German. She’s toured in Germany twice this year already.) I played billiards (actually, pool) with them twice. Me, Oliver, and Axel. Dorothée doesn’t talk. Sometimes she smiles or lets Oliver kiss her. Oh, young teenage girls… how do they live to adulthood? Anyway, on basically 2 different nights I did the rounds of the bars in town. Slim pickings.
Tonight – later – I am going out to meet Keith, who is the other English assistant in town, at the other high school. He’s British. I just met him Thursday, when we found out about one another. He seems ok – he could go either of two ways: (1) boring, bland, mild or (2) nice, friendly, good to do things with. I haven’t figured it out at this point. He knows all the English assistants in this whole area (all British) and they have been going out and doing things together since the beginning. One girl who is closest to us has a  car . So now I have a link to other people in my same situation. YAY! I have basically been sad in my room for six weeks, in between little excursions, etc, so I’m ready.
I feel now my letters have become so boring and informational to you. Are you bored? It is my campaign in the pursuit of sincerity. Isn’t sincerity what you have always wanted? Are you mad at me?
I heard you went out with my pal Susannah. So is your social life just hopping nowadays? How’s your roommate, housemate, whatever? Do you feel pressure when doing things with friends of friends? That you have to like the friend’s friend?
It is becoming deepest evening here in western West Germany. I just ate my meal of beer and lentil soup and pretzels and I am listening to my new Smiths tape, which is pure genius, by the way. This is all for the sake of pure atmosphere, by the way, and should by no means be considered as part of the letter’s content.
I cut all my hair off, too, which is something I tend to do when I’m bored/frustrated. First I trimmed it, then it got shorter and shorter.
Tomorrow I am going to Frankfurt just for the day. I am not sure exactly what I am going to do there, but the nephew of my landlords invited me along. Next week I will probably go on a school trip to Cologne to the museums. That will be the fun. (I can hear my landlords having one of their numerous arguments downstairs as I write this. They have those frequent kind of arguments which happy couples still sometimes have).
 Hello  – dear Brian, whose middle name I don’t know. Do you even have a middle name? I suppose you know mine. NOW it is Tuesday afternoon and I am not exactly rotting, but rather being quite indecisive. I may go to a concert tonight, I may go swimming, for a walk, into town on the bus to buy groceries. I made plans with two different people to take the train into Saarbrücken today; both fell through. The 2nd falling through was disappointing, however. Now I am reconnaissancing (?) by sitting in the warm sun of my window. I am trying to convince myself that my life doesn’t suck. I am going through a phase where I wish I weren’t burdened with a body, things, surrounding, etc, misc; I am sick of clothes, food, hands, hair, things like bags. This is all very abstract and dissatisfying. It happened to me before at Middlebury one summer, too. I am not into being alone at this time (and unfortunately I am) because I am not enjoying my company very much. I find myself walking places and talking to myself in a very obnoxious, condescending manner. I keep having to whistle or sing (“Suzanne Vega’s Greatest Hits”) to keep myself from thinking. Otherwise I find myself rapping myself on the forehead with my umbrella. I hope this is all only temporary…. I dug your party letter out of a pile of “things” in a drawer and just re-read it. It was great. I never get bored reading it.
SO PLEASE WRITE ME.
You see, I have given up all pretense of being blasé, indifferent, cool about not hearing from you. (Incredible spelling Hell today. Have you noticed?) I really miss you and think about you a lot. I am sorry that our friendship is on hold again. – But I would love to hear from you, ok? Don’t be mad, don’t hate me, etc, etc	ET CETERA (“exetera”)
please?
love   M.  .

#1 hot tip: the new “Smiths” album is brilliant
#2 hot tip: buy pork bellies
Hot gossip A-3B: I started smoking. OK, so I just started last night, but I did buy the pack myself. Some man in a bar made fun of the way I opened the package. God, what a dilettante.

“You do that all the time.” -- Evan Rothfield, in reference to the frequency with which I claim not to care about important things
Dear Melissa,
       Sorry. My whirlwind social life has prevented me from writing. Perhaps I could appease you with a small monetary donation. Yes?
       I was ticked when you left. You said that you would call before you departed, but it didn’t happen. I actually sat around waiting for the phone to ring. I’m sure you had a lot to do to get ready, but I don’t know....
       Well, Susannah and I went out, as I imagine she has told you. It was fun. She seemed different than on that weird night watching TV at your house when I first met her. I told her I’d call her, but I haven’t. I don’t know why (which I guess makes my attitude in the above paragraph rather untenable). I gather from watching years of sitcoms and stuff on TV that not calling a girl is a typical Male Bad Thing, so I feel not only guilty, but unoriginal. I asked my friends who know the definitions of these kinds of things, and they said that Susannah and I had officially been on a Date. Wow...
       If you have it with you, could you please xerox and send me a copy of the famous “Brian goes to a party” letter? Thank you.
       Bill says to write, “Vie vars mit une gemusel platte.” He says to say it comes from my heart. It comes from my heart. I hope it means something good.
       
“I’m glad you didn’t get lost” — Susannah Mooney
       All I ever really think about is my car. I work in Salem, which is about a 45-minute drive from Brighton.

This is a crummy letter, especially with the sudden stop. If there was more to it, I don’t have it.



November 6, 1987 – From Melissa
Dear Brian,
Don’t expect great things from this letter. I’m sick as a dog (how sick do dogs get? you ask. Put away that thought.) I got your letter. It made me happy. My one aim in my last letter was to incite you into letter-writing action. I’m glad I was effective. Now I have renewed faith in my abilities.
Needless to say, I am indoors rotting. It just so happens that it’s a beautiful, clear, mild day, too, but I’ve been in my room about a million years. I have a dreadful cold. I guess everything here is the same – sometimes good, sometimes bad, sometimes oh-so-normal. It’s hard to say which right now. Last week I had vacation and since I got back I haven’t accomplished any of those things on my short list. For instance – going to the university. I am not registered in any classes or anything. Oh well.
For my vacation I went to Bramsche, a little town up in North Germany, near a bigger town called Osnabrück. Osnabrück is big. It has a university and a McDonald’s and everything. I visited this girl, Rosa, from Philadelphia. She’s an English assistant there (in Bramsche). We met at our 4-day orientation in August bug I liked her a lot despite only seeing her a little. We got along really well, too. It was fun to be away from here, but hard to come back, too. I came back last Saturday (Oct 31) and went to a birthday party. It was a typical German gathering. We all sat around on couches and no one made any conversation unless it was absolutely necessary. No one that didn’t know everyone already got introduced to anybody. Somehow this all went on for hours.… I didn’t leave until 4:00 A.M. I probably owe my illness to all this excess fun.
The most exciting, new thing in my life is my purchase of 4 wine (red wine, burgundy) glasses. They look like this: 🍷 Or something like this. Use your imagination, ok? ANYWAY, they are beautiful and make my world just a little more complete than it might have been otherwise. Anyway, what they most inspire is a sort of an epic indifference – you are compelled to pace a room holding one between the fingers of your hand, gesticulating grandly with the other hand. You might even wax poetic, or light up a very fancy English cigarette. You find it impossible to stay seated or to remain modest. I am expecting great things out of them.
I left this letter sit alone on my desk for almost 2 days and in that time it was marked by chocolate and other unidentified substances. Nothing illicit, don’t worry… Now it is Saturday and I just got back from shopping. I feel like such a real adult when I go shopping (no longer just makeshift). There was no bus and I had bought all these things like onions and carrots and liter contains of orange juice and I had to walk home the ½-hour walk carrying my heavy burden. All the way I kept telling myself: “You are young and strong…” Now I’m making coffee.
Last night I went out – I was so sick of being an invalid in a boring, finite existence. At 6:00 or so (I was due to be picked up at 7:30) I had an absolute fit for cigarettes. I hadn’t smoked in a week because I was sick. (I haven’t had any alcohol in so long either. Aren’t I good?) But it was a question of obtaining cigarettes or nervous insanity. To make a long, totally uninteresting story short, I went to great lengths to get those cigarettes. It would have been easy, but I had the wrong change so I went on a 45-minute odyssey into town. I recently became friends with these two girls, Petra (Louise Brooks look-alike) and Ulrike (tall, blond, greeneyed, quiet) with whom I went dancing last night. I had already been to this disco once before – it’s called “Sound” and is in a neighboring town. When we first got there they played The Smiths and The Cure and David Bowie and R.E.M. and even The Doors. Later it got bad though. It was the cool hang-out scene. I feel proud to have been a part of it. I was doing well at my main goal, integration. (More on this later) A friend of my one friend here came up and talked to me, and this guy (his name is Achim) is the epitome of cool. I guess it’s my new radical haircut (shaved in the back and on the sides, sticking up on the top) or maybe it was my tie-dyed leggings. What are your thoughts on this matter?
As to integration = I am doing well with the students. I’ve gone dancing, drinking, pool-playing, window-shopping, to parties with them. One student who doesn’t know me personally did come up to me the other day and address m in the “Sie” (formal) form, but that’s pretty unusual. (The students call all the teachers “Sie,” but the teachers say “du” to them. I am on “du” terms with some of the teachers and all of the students. Being called “Sie” at the age of 23 is like being called Miss Jones (which I am still eradicating from some sections of the school. Most of the teachers call me that, though, or, even worse, they Mrs Jones, not knowing the difference!) Only one time have I really been accepted into a teacher group – I got invited to dinner by one teacher (and his 21 year old, former student girlfriend). Two other teachers were there as well as a visiting British teacher of German. We ate dinner and drank about 3 different wines, 2 schnapps and sat around the table until 4:00 A.M. I learned all kinds of different things. (The students – for some odd reason – on first sight trusted me completely and have told me all the gossip the school.) So at this party I heard the other side. Two of the teachers (both English teachers with whom I work) started telling me how everyone in the whole place knows what everyone else is doing. They told me all the things they’d heard from students about me. Thank god I haven’t done anything horrible…. It’s a very strange school. I know of 3 teachers who have student girlfriends. One teacher had a nervous breakdown last week and now everyone’s talking about that. (A word of warning: the one who cracked was a math teacher).
I hope this letter isn’t boring you to tears. I just recalled that you didn’t say a word about your workplace (I love that word) but now I’m going on and on about mine. (O.K. so it’s not really mine, I’m just borrowing it.)
I’ll tell you about this guy, Achim. He cracks me up because he’s too cool to live. First, I was observing him at the birthday party. His gestures, his expressions and the way he talked to people – it was all just too much. He is small and slicks his hair back over his forehead with gel or something. He wears jeans with the cuffs rolled up and white socks with little black boots. He wears turtlenecks tucked into his jeans with a wide belt at the waist and he has one earring. He rolls his own cigarettes. Last night I watched him dancing and he looked like a pixie (use your imagination). The thing that intrigued me about him, however, was that he never talked to me. I am pretty good friends with his friend Axel and I am always talking to Axel when Achim is there, but Achim studiously avoided having to say anything to me. This he mainly accomplished by looking away until I was gone. Then, at the party, he could no longer avoid it – he came up to me and said in an exaggerated foppish voice, “Do you happen to have a light?” After that, he had broken the ice or something and started actually conversing with me. On Tuesday I had to take over his and Axel’s English class for 2 hours because their teacher was in NY for the NY Marathon. I was nervous as hell and I so didn’t want to do it. And for some strange reason Achim took it upon himself to be the perfect student – he tried to answer every question and looked at me attentively the whole time. Every time I looked in his direction I had to keep myself from laughing. Afterward he told me that next time I’d have to pay him.
So that’s the Achim story. Was it worth it? Here’s the Axel story (I don’t know if I already told you about him). He is pretty cool – I do things with him about 3 times a week. Everyone in school thinks we’re … you know. He is one of those computer/math people, like you. I don’t let him talk about that stuff to me, though. I have my moral standards, you know. The funny thing is I think Axel speaks English which is exactly at the same level as my German. We usually speak 50-50 one language or the other. (in English! We speak each language half the time). Sometimes I get too lazy speaking German all the time, although my true main goal of the year (as opposed to my social-survival goal of integration and assimilation) is to perfect my German. What happens after that, I don’t know.
I wish I could remember what I wrote to you in my other letters. I have a terrible fear of repeating information, of repeating phrases (which float around in my mind indefinitely and sometimes suffer the ignominious fate of being used several times).
I really was sorry that you were mad/hurt that I left without calling you. Really, really. I was really scared that you just weren’t going to write me, too, that it had been just too much stupid effort and trouble to try and cement some kind of friendship with me. I remember one time in the summer – right before you left and maybe on the night that you told Peter you were going to do something with me without him and he stormed out – you seemed to suggest at some point that all the fuss wasn’t worth it, seeing how you and I were barely friends. On the phone or something you told me you didn’t really feel like seeing me because of the hassle, and the idea was so awful to me. It meant so much to me to be considered either (A) an important friend or (B) an important near-friend to you. For the first time I started thinking how we had been sort of friendly non-friends for years and I began to wonder why. It seemed like such a waste, especially since for a while we were actually in the same suburb radius (not to mention on the same continent) for extended periods of time. I can’t even exactly pinpoint just when you became so important to me as a friend. At school I remember I started living for your letters, but it always came and went in spurts. Sometimes I wrote a lot, sometimes you did. Remember the night you and Peter and I spent at Montrose and on the turf? Remember the time at Holly’s when you and I ended up on the couch? What did you ever think of that? – Now I’ve suddenly forgotten why I started writing all this. I guess I am worried that you think I will “shirk” things, as you have often accused me doing in answer to something in a letter from you, or to an “event.” It’s true, in general I tend to avoid thinking of difficult things – I put things away in the back of my head and prattle on about innocuous details. (A very bad habit to cultivate as a student. I don’t know how I made it through college). But also I find it very hard to express real emotion in an analytical sort of way. I mean, as in “I feel ____ because ____.” It is easier for me to be hurt or be angry and sometimes I never even need to reveal the underlying reason why. – Not that people who say they know why they feel or act a certain way are always right. I don’t think people could ever know it of themselves completely. Also, I find that quite often I miss emotional cues from people. They are expecting something – a reaction or something – from me and I am oblivious. This happens a lot.
I had to start a new paragraph because suddenly I was talking about unknowns in very abstract terms and I had to escape. Let me just say this: I hope we can keep in close contact this year, since it’s the only outlet open to us as I’m a trillion light years away. (Will it help if I also send postcards with myself penciled into the locations?) Who knows – maybe next year I’ll end up in Boston doing some job very beneficial to society in general. I’m keeping my options open (If they were any more open they’d be infinite). Maybe if I’m there we could actually see each other more than 3 times a year. What do you say?
As to my “ridiculously good-natured” boyfriend (any one of his friends or acquaintances would congratulate you on your particularly apt phrase) – he and I are writing each other pretty regularly (some of us more regularly than others, but I have understanding for my fellow humans who aren’t as blessed in the letter dept. as I). Mostly he works, and he’s working on his portfolio for grad schools, too. He is trying to come visit me in the spring so we can take a trip down into Italy and around Germany. I have a lot of time off from school then. It’s true we “broke up” way back at the beginning of the summer. I wasn’t thrilled about this at the time (an understatement) but now I am glad. It means I take him less for granted as a friend and also it means I don’t have to worry about my irresponsible behavior hurting him. I guess I can say without even being flippant that I am the kind of girlfriend you can’t trust through long absences – for instance, stays out of the country lasting a year or so. I hope (I console myself, at least) I am a much better friend. Much more faithful.
Do you want to hear the scary news? One of my college friends (that phrase makes me sound about 45 or so) just wrote me she’s getting married next May. She was the first person I met at all of Oberlin but I haven’t seen her in over a year. She is marrying some lawyer that she worked for briefly. She wrote me she was all embroiled in wedding plans, etc. I was happy for her being so happy, but in my letter back to her I had to restrain myself from asking if they’d have pink matchbooks at the wedding with their names embossed in gold upon them (with the date, surrounded by a heart…)
Have you heard from Peter at all? Or about him? I get letters from time to time from Marcia. She is always very good about writing, returning letters, etc. It takes a lot of energy to write her, though. I am not sure why – maybe because I need to summon enthusiasm to do it, it just doesn’t come naturally (as, for instance when I write you or Susannah or Eric). Something about her is fundamentally different from me, and I don’t mean the superficial things like her lifestyle, her choice of “things”. It is sort of sad [to] think that for all that time (“the best years of my life”) we might only have been “situation-friends”, i.e. now that our landscapes are different, we have nothing in common. Actually, to a certain extent this is also the case with Holly (sorry – don’t cry. It may be true). We never write one another, but besides that we are into totally different things and I am no longer a priori into the things she’s into (just because she’s Holly.) I don’t know what changed. Maybe she changed more than me. Aren’t I the same old Melissa (Missy)?
Now this current issue of your “tome” is coming to a close. My hand needs a rest.
P.S. I’m glad to hear our friendship isn’t “on hold”. I hate being on hold. I hate the Muzak most of all.
P.P.S. Don’t I look sheepish in the photo you sent of you, Alex and me? Who’s the baby?
 Write soon  – no really. I really mean it. Everyone says it but I really mean it. So do it, ok?
Write soon.
       love, Melissa
P.P.P.S. Is this letter good? Did I do a good job? You expect an awful lot form me sometimes, I think. It’s not an easy job being Brian’s Missy you know. (This is all written half in jest.)
– the Last P.S. of All –
Have you ever seen “Paris, Texas”? It is the most wonderful film. Especially the kid. What the hell is the deal with your car? In the summer I had the impression it was so user-friendly?


























 


December 12, 1987 – From Melissa
Dear Brian,
(There was an irritating pause between my resolution to write you and the actual putting-down of your name on paper in which I searched my room for a pen; not finding one, I had to resort to cleaning my fountain pen and then scribbling away on scratch paper for 10 minutes in a near-vain attempt to make it work. Now I see it is starting to warm to the idea of writing a letter. Nothing personal, I’m sure).
First of all, my New Year’s Resolutions:
A. I will never tell any of my friends ever again that you are brilliant, wonderful, or even above ordinary. I will tell them that I like you and that you live near Boston. Any objections?
B. I will never mention you and computers (or more specifically, you and your computer) in the same breath again.
C. I will be less passive.
D. I will be nicer to my guitar.
So what do you think? I am sitting in my room on a Saturday evening at 6:10, drinking (good) French red wine (Beaujolais primeur – it actually cost about 3,59 DM for the bottle (almost $4.00) and listening to XTC and cooking potatoes to eat for dinner. I’ve been in my room all day – reading. Reading is the thing I do best, in case you didn’t know. (I almost wrote “most” instead of “best” – I think a Freudian slip). Eric sent me a Christmas package which I decided not to open, but then I just did anyway. I read the novel Consenting Adults or The Duchess would be furious by Peter de Vries, yesterday and today. I didn’t like it, so don’t run out and check it out from the library or anything. Then today I started reading the Collection of Best American Essays 1987 – some are really excellent. In fact, one of them I want to xerox for you. It blew my mind away in similar manner to the article you sent me. Lately I have just been too lazy to write or play my guitar or even make Christmas cards for people. It is a shameful situation. – The Christmas package also has a Smiths T-shirt in it, but I’m going to pretend I don’t know and leave it in there.
I can’t remember if I told you or not that my mother’s coming for Christmas. She’s arriving next Thursday, the 17th and then she’ll leave the 29th. I’m actually sort of worried about it. I lie awake nights hoping “everything will work out ok.” I’ve never had my mother visit me anywhere, and especially not for an important holiday. One time she did come for 2 days at school – it rained the whole time, and the meal we ate at my co-op was atrocious. Also, it’ll be sort of a tight situation here at my house. There’s only one bath in the whole house, and it’s downstairs in my landlord’s apartment. Also, their son and daughter-in-law will be here for about 2 weeks and will occupy the two single beds in the other room upstairs. So my mother will either sleep in my bed and I on the floor, or we’ll have to share the single bed. The thing that really disturbs me about it is that when I discussed it with my landlords, the man suggested I ask a student from the school who is “well taken-care-of”, as he put it, if my mom could sleep at their house. – For Christmas!! – And my mother doesn’t speak one word of German. She’d rather stay in a hotel than that. At least she’s rented a car and so we’ll be able to take off whenever we want.
I can’t believe I just told you this whole long story. Will you ever forgive me? I have a great fear of being boring, but you wouldn’t believe it from the way I throw myself into long, inappropriate stories. But if something’s on my mind, it’s all I can think about or talk about to the exclusion of most else. Also, if I’m distracted and a million things are streaming through my head, I can’t concentrate on any one thing. Hence, the letters wherein I discuss my fan and my dirty clothes and the room temperature, etc.
I will try to think of news to tell you. I got all my hair cut off. I don’t really like it that much, though other people do. I feel too naked now. I wish I still had the past-shoulder-length hair of this spring. Did you ever see it? – Recently I wrote a long, revealing letter to Holly. Are you glad? Somehow I had the feeling that this would make you glad. I hope she writes back, though she may not for a while. She is like me – she needs to have the mood, as well as the time and the need, to write. – I haven’t heard from Susannah in a long, long time and it makes me very sad. We had a very good correspondence going ever since I’ve been here – we both sent about 2 long letters a week. Now I don’t know what’s happened. Did you ever call her? A while ago she underwent a sort of sticky breakup with the Carnegie-Meli. boy she was seeing. He kept calling her house and threatening her and would come to her door at 7 AM and wake her whole family up. – Also, I pity anyone who has to live with Erik Booth, the Hell-boy, my enemy. Did you ever meet him? Did you end up seeing Peter at Thanksgiving? I still haven’t gotten around to writing him – I have to send it to Va. anyway but I have no school address for him. – On Thanksgiving here I had to go to school and teach and that night I had choir rehearsal.
I have sort of been having a romance, since about a week I guess. It is nice, like friendship, and no one knows about it, but not very “intense” or anything because I still feel the same way about Eric and all. Mostly, no one else knows about it because I am that “young teacher” and he (his name is Axel) is a student and it is a small town. Everyone already talks about everything I do and who with, etc. anyway. Axel is 18 – he’s in his last year of school. We became friends because we both liked Suzanne Vega.
ANYWAY, tonight I am going out dancing with all these people.
January 3, 1988 – You see all the time that has gone by. Now I have caught your disease. Atrocious. My Reflections on 1988 so far: it rains a lot. 1988 is easier to write than 1987.
I finally got a letter from Susannah – she said she’s moving (has moved) back to Pittsburgh, where she got a job. She will live with her parents until she can find her own place.
Did you go home for the holidays? I missed Virginia. Was it nice? Did you see anyone? It was warm and wet here – no snow. My mom and I drove all around and got invited over to peoples’ houses a lot for coffee and cake. As soon as she left I felt (and still do) terribly guilty for not having been more patient with her, less distracted and selfish. Now it’s sort of lonely here. School starts Tuesday (I don’t have to go until Thursday) and all I feel like doing is going out, going dancing or something. I feel even less psyched about teaching than I did before (which was very little). I can’t believe I have 5 or 6 more months to teach! Take my advice – never teach. I hate it. But I like being in Germany. Germany doesn’t seem foreign to me anymore – it seems normal. I guess this is the point at which culture shock would ensue if I returned to the States. I love the states. I am going to punch the next person who makes some stupid comment about America like “All Americans eat in the car.” My new theory – you can’t see or understand your own country completely until you’ve lived abroad (not just visited – visits distort a country’s true qualities). Not that I am now the Einstein of American Culture Studies. Write me. Love, Melissa

It looks like I still wasn’t consistently keeping copies of what I wrote, so I’m missing the letter that you were responding to.











1988
February 3, 1988 – From Melissa
Dear Brian:
Where are you, my friend? It is raining here and I am listening to the radio at 2:45 A.M. – “Radio Luxembourg” – it’s in English. I’m probably smoking too many cigarettes. I suppose you’d say your life is unchanged – I really don’t have anything to say, but I can’t go to sleep anymore – the last few nights I can’t shut my eyes before 5:00 and it doesn’t matter if I sleep until 7:00 or 1:00 – it’s all the same. So here I am – on a sheet of paper. I think it’s your turn to write me, but I don’t mind, I’m tolerant. But don’t expect any wit or brilliance – I feeling a little off-centered. If Suzanne Vega would just put out another album I think it would all be OK.
I want to learn to play bass – electric bass. It is my dream and I must fulfill it or perish. I am so sick of the German school system, the grading system, the plight of young men who must go in the army. Lately I’ve gone dancing – that is, I’ve gone to discos, but I haven’t danced much there, even though they played the Smiths and the Doors, etc. Is it raining all over the world? Also I’ve been going swimming – I love immersing my body in chlorine and then colliding it with the unknown bodies of elderly people who don’t care about my dream of the perfect lap and think they own the pool.
How was Christmas in Virginia?
Lately I’ve just been reading all the time – almost all in German. It is so difficult to be alone and then to go out and be properly with people – I start believing in the world of the book then the modern life of the outside world is such a shocking revolution or revelation. I think T.V. is the only adequate antidote for this – I think I talk about T.V. in a disproportionate, misleading way – so sue me. Did you see the David Letterman with Crispin Glover on? I heard about it.
I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE. Not at all. I think this is a problem. Is there life after college – really? I feel so unfulfilled – the troubles of my chaotic times are getting to me – that unhealthy teetering between socialism and consumerism. Is there meaning in Paisley? Funnily enough, it isn’t any more difficult to smoke lying on your back – I just tried it. I am so longing to play frisbee. Do you play frisbee? If so, let’s play when I come back. Maybe I can come visit you for a short while when I get back. You can help me decide about my Way and my Path. Are you ever going back to school? – Oh, I just remembered I do have news, exciting news – my sister is going to have twins. In July. Then she’s moving to Florida. Holly is living in Reston again and doing an internship for an organization called Council for Traditional Music and Arts. I think music might be the only thing that matters – all the more reason to learn to play electric bass. If only I had popcorn as well. POPCORN.
Now I must must must go to bed – I hope – I wish. I want – I’ll try. And you – be good be good be good – be something. Love Melissa

March 7, 1988 – From Melissa

 


July 4, 1988 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Missy,
I don’t even know where to send this. I am sorry I have not written in so long. I think I got confused and stopped understanding what was going on in our letters with us, and this writing stuff.
So… where are you anyway? God knows. I certainly hope you haven’t left the planet or anything without telling me. How was the end of teaching and Europe and all that galivanting you’ve been up to? No, honestly, I’m interested…
My favorite word these days is “verging.” I like the way it can mean “changing.” I still say “Choose me” all the time, too. That’s you, yes? Makes me think of you, anyway. My new hero is Natalie Merchant (10,000 Maniacs). Carolyn (my sister) tells me there is a new Suzanne Vega song/album. That’s everything I know about words and songs.
I am still way cool. It’s kind of a secret though, so don’t tell anyone. Life here is a struggle. I am so anti-social sometimes, it’s hard getting to know people. Yeah, I know, poor Brian.

I was fond of “verging” because it was used to nice effect in a 10,000 Maniacs song called “Verdi Cries” that I first heard back then (and have adored ever since).
This letter petered out and was never finished. I wanted to talk about “us” but didn’t know how to broach the topic, or if I should, or what I wanted to say.

July 7, 1988 – From Melissa
Dear Bri,
First of all, yesterday, I sorted out all the letters I have in Germany. I put 99.8% of them in a box to send to America. There were actually 3 letters among the Germany letters which I brought with me from the US. One was hate mail from Erik Booth, one was the first letter (two pages long) written to me by my niece Allison when she was seven, one was the infamous party letter you wrote me at least a year and a half ago. The latter to of these letters I saved for an extended stay in Germany. The latter I just reread a minute ago. I thought: What the hell is Brian doing with his life and why hasn’t he written me in about one zillion light years? So, although I have a massive headache, I decided to write you. – How’s that for an introduction to a long overdue letter?
I have a new apartment, as of about 3 days. Now I live in Saarbrücken, a real live city (though “mini”) Here is my address, by the way:
Melissa Jones	(← No changes there)
Beethovenstr. 27
6600 Saarbrücken
West Germany
(0681) 34727
I am seriously trying to decide what to do with my life. It has just occurred to me that Germany, as well, could be a part of the real world. I hate teaching English, and, in fact, for one official week now I am no longer a demi-high school teacher. I am actually an illegal alien of sorts, an official student, and an unofficial lost soul. In August I’m supposed to start teaching English again, at a private school. In the meantime, I’m trying to find a decent real job. I need money and peace of mind; I can’t decide which I need more. How is it possible that one can have studied pure theory for years, attained a respectable degree, and yet be a societal misfit of the first order? I have realized that I have absolutely NO practical knowledge – not even “traditional feminine” knowledge: i.e. I can’t sew, cook or knit worth beans. I’d like to become a carpenter or a printer or a copy editor. Do you think there is hope for me?
Now for the more substantial parts of the letter. I don’t know how much longer I’ll be in Germany. America seems so illusory and juicy from this distance. But I suppose I’ll at least be around another year. Will we be non-friends when I come back? Are we non-friends now?
I have a great room in an apartment in the center of the city. I hear cars and people talking in the street at all hours. 4 other people live here: a guy from Tunisia, a woman from Switzerland, and two German guys. I’ve only just moved in, and am slow on the uptake anyway, but I think we’re getting along OK. We eat meals together (at night), talk, drink win, and mostly go our own ways. At this point I don’t have much of a way to go. I’m getting settled in and looking for things for my room and looking for a job. I may get hired at this one family [?] restaurant, but that would be just for money. What I need is a life. Do you have a life? Of course I live most of my existence immersed in books, poems, paper, music, pictures. But I feel quite a fifth wheel in the physical world. I don’t actually want to live in “the real world” so much as I feel out of it as a physical being. I need to go swimming and do manual labor.
I have to write fast or else my headache will overcome me and I’ll have to turn out the light and lie still in a warm place. I wish I could think of interesting things to tell you. Oh wait – I just thought of one. My sister Vicki had twins a week ago today. One is called Elizabeth and the other, Evangeline. Evangeline is smaller and came out feet first. Today this friend of mine, in his typical manner, told me that 95% of the time, one twin is psychically (← sp) handicapped. I just ignored him. He had just been berating me because I’d hitchhiked from Saarbrücken to Merzig (about as far as from Reston to D.C.) I went and played pool and won both games. I felt happy and proud. I am pretty successful at hitchhiking, although it took me 3 rides to get all the way there. I was too stingy to take the train. It helps when you wear a miniskirt and black patent leather shoes with bows on them. I would never do it at night, though. I’m not completely crazy.
My room is great – it has a high ceiling, two large windows facing the street with lots of light, one wall covered with giant book shelves, and a dresser. Also a mattress on the floor. My room in Merzig was so small, so dark, so quiet. Tomorrow I buy sheets and a pillow. I’ve been smoking like crazy ever since I’ve become “Germanized.” It’s gotten to the point where I’m surprised to meet a non-smoker. Not like America. I never smoked in America. I really wish you’d write me and tell me some things. Do you think you can manage it? I hope you live the same address. Tomorrow I’m going to see “Clockwork Orange.” It rains here every day. But I was in the South of France for a week, where the sun shone, and I got tan. I spoke this horrible French.
My one trusty, faithful plant is thriving here in its new environment, which I guess is a good sign. Unfortunately, the headache has eaten me so I will end this, ok?
       Write me for once.
       please?
       Love, Missy








July 18, 1988 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Missy,
Well, look, as you once said to me (in reverse) it is quite difficult being Missy’s Brian. Darn near impossible, as a matter of fact. It was a lot easier when we knew each other only through our letters. But now when I get a letter from you, I think of you writing it, wherever it is you are, so far away. And there is none of the old feeling of a sort of literary detachment.
I am not sure I am the same person even who wrote the Infamous Party Letter. It is harder for me now to pay attention to “stuff”: events, actions, surroundings than it was then. I seem to have followed this inward path, even without consciously deciding to. And do I know if this means anything to you? No. I have this intense fear of opening more of myself to people than they care to deal with just then. Fear of overwhelming someone because the desire to share is so strong. Even that letter is good only because I was so obsessed with what I was doing and doing it all just to tell you about it. Not just to write it down well, but tell you – Missy.
So. I am still me, and I still find it impossible to pass up a wise-ass line, but I’ll take passion over with and attitude any day. And that’s why I care so much about you and am blown away every time we are together. There is more there than the mutual intellectual admiration of a few years ago, but I have no way of knowing whether this is appropriate. You maintain this charming obliviousness because you are unaware of people expecting things from you. Yet there have been those rare moments when there was no distance between us. I think of drinking beers in D.C. with Peter and kissing on your sofa and saying “choose me” at every fucking opportunity. You know? Maybe not.
love,
Brian
P.S. Okay, this is the good part of the letter. I just read what I wrote and, well, it certainly has that hallucinatory intensity that I am known for (just ask Peter). I apologize if it seems harsh. I think it is chemical or something. You can blame my parents, if you like. Anyway, thank you for putting up with me and continuing to write and everything. I thought you might have given up and I’m glad you didn’t.
P.P.S. In response to your question, no, I have no life.
MISSING YOU DUMMY. COME HOME!

I lacked the courage to send this until years later.





August 10, 1988 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Missy,
This is what I think: I have lost the ability to write. This is the third time I have started this letter. It is so difficult to put one word after another; I want to write them all at once and assume you will understand. I almost wrote you a drawing instead, as that comes as a whole, but could not begin to figure out how to draw what I want to say.
So I figured I would start with easy stuff and see how that went. I was exhausted all day, but it is now 1:30 am and I am wide awake. Last night I attended an introduction to something called The Forum, which is what EST has mutated into. It purports to be something of a revelation in self-understanding, -awareness, etc. My roommate (Evan) just completed a two-weekend course and loved it, so I went to see what it was like. It was horrendous and exhausting and frightening. I was overwhelmed by the desire these people had to get me to sign up. I had to be very much myself just to get through the evening. Now it is the next day and the events are still echoing in my head. Evan signed up for the six-day course: $1200.
That’s why I was exhausted. I didn’t get back until late, and even than Evan and I stayed up another hour talking about it. Our friend Julie was there, too, and she had become even more upset than I. She had just lost her boyfriend to Dianetics (Scientology) and was totally thrown by the similarities between what he described to her and what she heard last night. She and Evan stayed up until four talking. I think it is a sore spot between Evan and I that I was so repulsed.
Anyway, I floated through the day so tired. But I took a nap and could not get to sleep later. I started fishing through a box of old letters. This is the hard part. There were letters form Marcia and the girl Sue who I was so in love with. The letters from Sue were so calm and friendly – I was mortified to remember how inappropriately intense my responses must have seemed to her.
Then I found the letter you wrote me after receiving the Party Letter. You told me how much you liked it, and how unsure you were about the tone of the closing paragraphs. Even then, there was so much pressure on you (from me) to be careful about what you said. I remembered criticizing your letters that time on mushrooms and calling our correspondence “intellectual” in my last letter. I wanted to take that word back as soon as I heard the envelope hit bottom in the mailbox. I apologize, not only for that, but for all the pressure I have put on you over so many years now. There is no good excuse.
The really hard part is that even in apologizing I can see how intense I am making this letter. I seem to have lost the zero point: it is either all the way in one direction or all the way in the other. Tomorrow, if I send this, I will probably start to regret these words and start to put even more energy into correcting the impression left by this correction. It is all rather self-indulgently circular and entangling. Perhaps you would like to hear about the weather instead.
There is this fear that I cannot control my feelings for people I care about. A genetic defect, I suppose. It has been this way in the past, and I have driven people away.
I wish you were here so I could hug you and not have to say anything. It is hard not knowing what these ideas mean to you. I miss you very much, especially right now as I write this. I am out of the right words again.
love,
Brian
P.S. Missy, just to keep our letters in sync, I should make clear that I wrote this before receiving a reply to my last letter.

That intro session for The Forum really was a horrible experience. Evan’s parents were hippies who were into EST, so I guess that explains his interest somewhat. But still, blech.
The rest of this letter is kind of interesting, but totally self-defeating, so I never sent it.
The clues here suggest that I did actually write and send you a letter during this period, but I don’t have a copy of it. The P.S. confuses me, though, since it seems to refer to a contemporaneous letter from you that I don’t have, so I’m not certain I have the timeline right here.
In any case, I stopped sending you letters because I was unable to express myself properly. I felt like a failure, and didn’t really expect to hear from you again.







1989
March 1989 – From Melissa
Dear Brian,
Hi. How’s tricks? I am actually writing you from Reston, VA. Who would have thought it? Suddenly, today, I was dying to call you. It was 11:48 P.M. I thought I would at least spare you that. Instead, a nice clean letter of introduction. I still wish I were calling you. Letters are not my friends lately. I found some old letters of yours. They made me all nostalgic and sentimental and just wishing you were here, but mostly that I were there since here is definitely not where it’s at. I am living at home. I’ve been here since December. I’m thinking of buying a car. I want to earn money to go back to school in October and get a degree to be a professional translator and interpreter. Living at home sucks in the first degree. Lately, I’ve developed a social life with mostly Holly, who is God’s gift to Melissa. I love her. She lives in Bethesda with her boyfriend of about 2 years, David. I do temp work during the long, drab winter days. It sucks. I don’t earn much and I like it even less, but I at least have some type of ungainful employment.
I never wrote you back because your last letter intimidated and froze the hell out of me. I decided I couldn’t do anything about anything. Is it what you expected of me? I hope you’re well. I’m about the same as ever, but would be better living in D.C. I love D.C. There are lots of Oberlin people there and we generally get together Tuesdays at Wollensky’s, which is right next to Tower Records. Most everyone has a hot shit job, even Jeannie Quinn. Actually, her job sounds boring, but she might give it to me when she goes to Italy in a month. I need it to finance my wheels. I’m going to tutor her in German. I tutor this kid from Wolf Trap twice a week and it’s fun. I am ostensibly trying to quit smoking. I just made the big move from Marlboro to Marlboro Lights and am very proud of myself. I love smoking and often enjoy the feeling of being a pariah among men (just a figure of speech) when I’m the only one in a group smoking (which is almost always the case). My mom is the same and will never change. I still let her upset me. My favorite time of day is late at night after she goes to bed, when I drink a couple of beers and smoke all the cigarettes of the day and watch “Hill Street Blues” or Dave Letterman.
Are you ever in D.C.? If so, you could look me up. I almost saw Peter during the Christmas holidays, but then I didn’t. I have a new phone no. 742-8472. WHAT’S NEW IN YOUR LIFE? Are you communicable, but not in the way of an illness?
I was in a pretty bad car wreck less than two weeks ago and hurt my back and was very lucky I didn’t die or anything. I totaled my mom’s car on Route 7 on the way to church. I totaled the other guys car, too, and also damaged a Metrobus. I have to go to court and everything because I failed to maintain proper control of my vehicle. My mom has a rental car. I need a Dodge Dart. I need you to write me, or call, and even make a formal stab at getting in contact with your former friend, Melissa or Missy or whatever. Think about it. You’re still on my One Hand List of People – the five people I think the highest of in my life.
With love, Miss.

This seems to confirm that I did write you a letter during 1988 (and it wasn’t very good, whatever it said).



March 12, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Missy,
Welcome home.
I tried to write you last night after a day of being, shall we say, rattled by your letter and various other intertwingled events. All of which seemed expressly designed to illuminate my life in the clearest possible way and make me feel really stupid. An inability to read your letter a second time led me to abandon my reply and read about seven Raymond Chandler [Carver, actually] short stories instead. I’m afraid my roommate thought me weird.
I was better today and even went out once for awhile. I spent a lot of time watching basketball on TV and getting bulkier on beef stroganoff. My friend Jeff calls me “husky” sometimes out of fake respect. And though some part of me would really prefer to read the paper or have a beer right now, I have resolved to write this letter or die trying. I feel that I owe you a rapid and somewhat rational reply, though I don’t want you to get the impression that I know how to deal with this situation at all. Because I can’t, and it has taken me 45 minutes or so to just get this far. Perhaps you can keep this in mind as you read.
I have to admit that I am amazed that your thinking of me produces nostalgia rather than hatred or pity. My last letter to you was not intended to scare you, it was simply a desperate attempt at honesty, though I was not surprised that you were unable to reply. I can only apologize for its tone, I had no desire to hurt you. Sorry.
There are lots of things I would like to say to you. I certainly wish we could be together. Perhaps I will be in D.C. soon. But now I am losing the ability to put words on the page. Write back if you would like to, though I have to say that my greatest fear is to become engaged in yet another set of abstractly passionate correspondences with you. We seem only able to deal with each other when comfortably separated by distance or the presence of other people, and I have no respect for us for being like that. I am going to do my best to strip all pretense from what I have to say to you. If you find this intimidating, then I suggest that you simply not respond. I am sorry to be so intense but I seem to have forgotten how to be any other way.
Life is good here. I am glad you are back from Germany. I am tempted to guess that you would not have written me if things were still good between you and Eric. Is this true? Say hi to Holly for me, my memories of her are pretty amazing. You are wonderful, I am so happy that you did not give up on me.
love,
Brian

Not a great letter, but at least I tried. It was extra dumb to mention Eric the way I did, though.



March 16, 1989 – From Melissa
Dear Bri,
Got your letter yesterday. Now I’m back at work, officially doing nothing because I’m on my lunch break, though I must say I often unofficially do nothing since there’s not too much to do here. I like the office where I am just fine, however, and I hope I can stay here for awhile. It’s within 5 minutes walking distance from my house and I can usually work about 8 hours a day, which makes being here at the ungodly hour of 8:30 OK. It is pretty mindless but I manage to get the good parts of the Post read and every day I add to my on-going letter to Holly. We see each other or talk on the phone in between times so the letter aspect of our new and developing relationship usually touches in greater detail upon the millions of issues we feel we must share. You are right about her being “amazing.” How did I ever live without her constant presence in my lie for so long – so many years? Last night she spent the night at my house and we practiced our new music, ate french fries and drank coffee at Friendly’s (the ultimate extended-stay café in convenient downtown Herndon) and spent hours catching up on all these THINGS. I’ve seen her pretty frequently since December but only maybe one other time without (a) her boyfriend (2) other people (3) both around, or at a party or something. On Saturday we want to go hang out at Great Falls since the weather is being ideal for it. I really like doing things with David and Holly together. I’ve never liked it before to be the “Third Person” in a relationship – I mean, when the other two are in a relationship and you’re the friend. It just usually isn’t fun or you feel like the third wheel – intimate matters crop up and you wish you were someplace else. Or just private conversations, which bore you. But I like it with Holly and David. It sometimes even happens that there’ll be a conversation in which I have no part – or personal trauma will occur, but nothing of the kind ever bugs me. I even enjoy “having my own space” or whatever the jargon is. And I have no problem with going off to let them settle something. The first night Holly and Dave came to my house to watch videos and spent the night, we all 3 sat on the couch and devoured chips and salsa and guzzled beer. We watched The Thin Blue Line and Something Wild and all lay across each other on the couch to watch Letterman. The lights were off, we fell asleep and woke at 3 A.M. to the awful sounds of the “Love Connection” coming on. We’ve all been dancing to Kilimanjaro’s in D.C., to some parties, to hang out at Holly’s mom’s house. They constitute 50% of my “social life” – the other house is composed of Oberlin people in the area. There are lots of them. You can’t run, you can’t hide.
So ANYWAY, that was the letter prelude. I was surprised that you thought – or were “tempted to think” that I wouldn’t have written you if things were still the same with Eric and me. For one thing, the logic and reasoning are all wrong; for another thing, you are just plain wrong. How do you even know I’m not involved with someone else – or with several others – or with anyone, period? Did I not write when I was still with Eric? I recall I did!
By the way, I guess I am involved with someone. He is 6,000 (?) miles away and we write infrequently. Meanwhile, I am doing stuff with people here. I keep my options open. As my friend Susan once said of me, I “fall in love like I breathe.” It is both a very good thing and a very bad thing. I have great fun and hell times as well, and so do a lot of other people. To tell the truth I am mourning Eric. He doesn’t stay in contact. He’s been going out with some architect since September and I haven’t seen him since June. I didn’t end it with him, though. We had an agreement to “go out with others.” I did. He said he wanted us to and he thought it best, but it turned out in the end that he didn’t mean it literally. So he was disappointed. I miss his friendship – not that things are on bad terms. He’s just gone, I suppose. I write him a lot and send him small things and always ask our mutual good friend, Dan (didn’t you mean Dan in Boston? Or not?) about him. I suppose I have an unspoken but understood agreement with my boyfriend of Germany – I’ll go out with other people, he’ll sleep with some. (He avoids “relationships” at all costs and works to bring about the other with equal fervor.) Meanwhile I’m having a non-romantic, sexual tension-filled friendship with an Oberlinite named Ben, whom I never knew at school, though we had ample opportunity to know one another. I met him sometime in February, I guess, at an Oberlin party. We “do things” together about once a week. I guess I have no expectations and no plans. Everything is so confusing, my life is scattered, I don’t know what kind of person I am turning out to be. I sometimes feel so wonderful, I sometimes feel I’m all wrong. I think I do everything wrong because it’s the easiest way. Other people make decisions, don’t they, then either carry them out or don’t, for one reason or another. But at least they start off with a Big Picture. Then, later, they can rally or revise. But if you go into things blindly and unconsciously, you can never analyze, make comparisons or succeed. You’re not sure where you started off, so you have no idea if you’ve gotten anywhere at all. I think it may be fine for right now but it will get worse as I get older. I don’t want to be sloppy and undeveloped at 40 years of age. So I imagine it’s time for me to start thinking out some big questions. Sorry for the metaphysical musings. I am feeling very thoughtful and neutral. Everything seems to hurt me just a bit or to shake me up, and yet it seems like I’m observing it almost coolly and trying to figure it all out. I think in terms of “life is fun” – or, just a little later, “life is silly,” or “this is confusing.” It’s all so distant.
I am determined, now I’ve decided what it is I’d like to do, to throw myself into it, to love it. I want to have my Future Work as my constant and my fun. I want to be able to make it first priority, if the time comes when I choose to do so or I need to do so.
Is this all too vague for you?
I’ve been trying to puzzle your letter out. It’s intense, I’ll give you that. I guess I’m confused. What is going on here? I know you’re glad to hear from me, I get the idea you want to see me. (OK. I know you’d still want to see me as much as I do you.) But I have the idea you see things differently from me. I still think of our relationship as something that’s never had the chance to get off the ground. Also, the last few times we saw each other before I left, the whole idea of the Future was so freaky, that we bungled lots of things ourselves. You’re right that we tried to “protect ourselves” by always seeing each other when other people were around, or that we only ever really acted “normal” in letters. And I know I work out my feelings, ideas, and the garbage that is just floating around in my psyche (if I may use the word) by writing distracted, baffling, detail-filled, witty worthless letters – not even letters, but energetic, non-communicating tours de force. I know this bugs you. – But what do you expect? Have we done so badly? What would you like that we’d have done completely differently? (This is a question I really hope you’ll answer. – Tell me what you think is wrong ←). Tell me, just tell me, what is wrong here. Am I slow to be missing “the point”? – And don’t think I’m “playing around” now – I really feel lost. What is “the situation?”
Let me take this moment to say I believe I’m writing a straightforward letter. Didn’t think I could do it, did you? – Don’t worry, don’t think an era is at an end. I still do write the other kind (or type? I can never get these two straight) of letter – quite frequently, in fact. I even wrote the masterpiece recently. It was a “first letter” so I had to make it good. It had the desired effect. The recipient was forced to call and express wonder and gratitude.
An intermission of interesting information is at hand. I just read The Accidental Tourist (I felt is was my duty, before seeing the film) and one part made me laugh because it reminded me of something I said that your “took issue” with (I love that expression). The main character described his irritation that Muriel always pronounced “et cetera” “eck cetera,” – very similar to my own “ex cetera.” –  According to the old formula, I would be tempted now to discuss books, movies, and so forth, but I guess I don’t really feel like it now. I would mean what I’d say but I wouldn’t care that much about saying it.
So ANYWAY, I guess I’m doing fine. I dream about getting my own car and pore over the ads in each paper every day (the alternative wording: in every paper each day). Hopefully I’ll get out to look at one this weekend. My mother is doing her utmost to make my life a living hell, and the fact that I always need her car just worsens matters to the nth degree. She has a new Buick. I’ve decided that my mom’s big issue is CONTROL. She hates the idea that she doesn’t have executive director’s rights in every area of every life touching on her own. She can’t stand for me to leave my books in the living room, for me to say out “late” (after 11:00), for me to make plans and not inform at the earliest possible time. When other people are around, she has to orchestrate everything, The Life of the Party Syndrome. Holly and my wonderful sister Vicki help me deal with it. Beside the little things, the underlying differences in belief systems and priorities make life at home tough. I come home from work and my mom is lying on the couch with the T.V. on, not really watching, but she can’t think of anything else to do with her time. I sit down to talk to her and sometimes end up watching a 6-hour stretch of T.V. I feel awful about myself then. My mom will barrage me with gossip re-runs about people I don’t even know from church, etc. She tells me in great detail about all her errands. I try to motivate myself to do the things I want to do, or enjoy, or find important, and I still get more and more bogged down. Her boyfriend Don comes over and they play 4 hours of gin rummy (every Wednesday and Sunday night). She never reads other than the crossword section of the paper (and comics and selected “Style” section articles), much less a book. I tell her ideas or impressions and she has no answer or anything. We never have a “discussion” of anything. Evenings after work I am so thirsty for a little conversation and company. But I can’t allow myself to make anymore phone calls – all my friends are long-distance, except Holly, who’s never home. The last bill was $34.00. I think I’ll start taking long walks. What a note to end my letter on; I’m sorry. But I want it to get to you ASAP. And I’m exhausted from the telling. Don’t hate me for writing a long, long letter. And slap yourself on the wrist for believing I could think your to be pitied or hated. Love, Miss.

I appreciate how forthright your letter is. I’m sorry I wasn’t good at explaining what was wrong or what I wanted. I hope it’s clearer now.
It still irks me when people pronounce “et cetera” incorrectly.















March 18, 1989 – From Brian (unsent)





This was an interesting experiment, but still very indirect. I think I was too embarrassed to send it.
March 19, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Missy,
I resent you for being able to write so much so well. Saturday I drove to work and spent a few hours on the computer writing you an elegant three-page piece of crap, the reading of which I will spare you. It is exceedingly difficult for me to handle the task of writing you when I have not even mustered this degree of honesty in person.
What is “wrong” is this. I will write it as concisely as possible because it looks silly on paper. 1) We have been in relationship limbo for years now, 2) I am not sure I know who you are, and 3) The similarities between how we are and how I am with other women in my life are striking and frustrating. OK? It is not so much a matter of things being wrong so much as they are frightening. My friend Karen says that I have a fear of being out of control, and perhaps that is the case here. I am sorry to seem so enigmatic, I would prefer to be transparent if I felt safe.
Otherwise, life here is good, if trippy as ever. I would relate details, but can’t think of any good ones that follow well here. It takes too many cigarettes to write you, please come to Boston. I miss you terribly. Remember those trips to D.C. with Peter to drink? And to visit Marcia in Charlottesville? Etc.
love,
Brian

I tried to boil my previous attempt down to essentials. At least my handwriting was top-notch at this point, if not my ability to express myself.
It seems that I included a mix tape that I made for you with this letter.


April 19, 1989 – From Melissa
Hi. How are you?
I have nothing to say and no time to write a letter. I am watching “The Wonder Years” on t.v. I have a million things I need to be doing but I’ve been needing to be doing them for literally months. I hate that. The only time I ever sit down to think is [while] commuting in my car every day to Bethesda and back. But then I can’t do anything about anything. I have the Beltway to worry about. I fear that just any day now I will wake up and discover that all the “deadlines” are come and I’m totally unprepared. Because meanwhile I’ll be watching T.V., working, driving, spending money I don’t actually have on things on I don’t actually like or want. There is so much to keep in mind!
I like the tape you made me and listen to it in my (aforementioned) car just about every day. I really like REM and my favorite REM song is the 2nd one on there after the “Superman” song. Do you remember when we drove downtown from your going away/graduation party in somebody’s car – one of your Brown friends? And we kept singing really loud to that song? Anyway, where did you find the hitherto unknown Smiths song – “Last of the International Playboys”? I like it.
Hi. Me again. 11:00 P.M. Soon I must go to bed, so that tomorrow I may awake. Things are OK here. I guess I like my new job. In 2 weeks I go on the road with Tour de Trump. It begins the 3rd when I drive a van from Atlantic City to JFK and pick up a team of German bicyclists, then take them to Albany. Life switches from being very eventful and busy to being totally uneventful and normal. My car is getting massive engine work from my uncle tonight, the poor dear. When are coming to VA? Next Sunday I am going to a (GASP!) bridal shower for Suzy and Marcia. Are you coming to the wedding(s)? Send word. Do it soon!
       Love, Missy




April 19, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Miss,
If I remembered what I put on the first one, I’d make you another tape. I’ve been communicating by audio tape a lot recently. Sent one to Peter the other day. Seems to work well for me, better than normal letters anyway. My sister makes them and then decorates the box and everything. It’s pretty cool. She seems to have become talented when I wasn’t looking. It’s pretty cool. When we were growing up, I was always the “smart” one and she was always the “artistic” one. I was of the secret opinion that I was more artistic than her, too. I was a modest child. Anyway, it’s apparently not true. She gave this cool painting for my apartment and the most artistic thing I can do is write letters on construction paper.
Look! A whole intelligent paragraph with no philosophical contortions of any sort. I’m so proud of myself. It’s been a while.
The Smiths song is actually the new solo Morrisey import song, though most of those other Smith types (except Marr) are on it too. Certainly sounds like the Smiths. I like writing that word: Smiths. Handwriting is everything. It’s the only reason I write. Which R.E.M. song? I seem to remember you liking “Cant Get There From Here,” if that’s the one you mean. I love that song. Every time it starts I think it’s just a throwaway song, but by the time it ends I remember how epically important it is. The bridge is the best part, which I will now reproduce on Page 2:
Hands down, Conichi (?) bound
Land locked kiss the ground
The dirt of 7 continents going round and round
Go on ahead Mr. city-wise hypnotized suit and tie
Gentleman justified
Or something like that. Jeff and I spent all our time in school figuring out impossible R.E.M. lyrics. It was very important to us, you see. I hate it now that they’re popular. They’re not cool anymore, I guess.
I’d be delighted to come for Marcia’s wedding provided she sends me a bona fide invitation on nice paper and embossed and everything. Tell Suzy I’ll have to make it to her next one instead. My mom tells me she saw an engagement announcement for Tricia Q. Banks in the paper. Could it be true? My first love. I really loved her, I think. Marcia shocked me in her last letter. She’s getting good at it. The one before she told me she was getting hitched, but she beat it with this new one. You won’t believe, I’ll show you when I come down. When is her fucking wedding anyway?
I can see now that it’ll do me no good to complain, but I have to say I’m still not comfortable with this whole situation. It breaks my heart to be this way even if you don’t see why. Take my word for it.
love,
Brian

I responded to you right away, but using construction paper as stationery was not one of my better ideas.




June 11, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Missy,
I have been studying for Marcia’s wedding. What are you going to give her? My mom says something practical, but I don’t know. Not that she was recommending toasters or anything, to give her credit. I just don’t want to get her (them, I suppose) an “adult” gift. This is my first peer wedding. I’m nervous, can you tell? I’ll be down Thursday evening and leaving Sunday sometime. Will you go to the wedding with me? And pretend you know me and stuff like that? Peter says he might drive down from Ohio, but he sounded pretty unconvinced. I don’t know how he thinks about the whole church ex-scene.
Anyway, in preparation I have been going through all my old letters. Jenifer Mitchell and Alison Wachtel used to write me letters. Mainly ‘cause I was in college and thus it was cool then to know me. I bought a box of those bindy things to help me organize everything. I got the small ones. I was shocked to find, however, that you (among others) have written at least this much: |← 1 inch →| in the few short years we have been corresponding. Mostly cutout cardboard crap, of course, but pretty impressive nonetheless.
I quote you from July 1, 1982. Buckhorn, I believe.
Peter came and talked to me for like 3 hours (until 2:00 in the morn) about everything in the world. He was a sweetheart. He spilled out his heart to me and did it so eloquently that I almost went crazy. And then last night I was so incredibly massively worried about him. He was a naughty boy and went running and met some “cool guys” who offered him Stroh’s and some kind of whiskey, which he accepted, of course.
Altogether a pretty interesting and frustrating letter. I always resented Peter for being an idiot about things and still getting the girl.
This is from Marcia’s last letter to me, Jan. 11 1989. She’d probably be pissed if she knew I was quoting her.
I was just telling my roommate Susie all about you and all the fun times we had in high school…. This is a weird thing to say to you, but I came to this realization with Susie – if you had asked me to come live up in Boston before all these commitments, I would have gone.
She tells me that she and Tom will be moving here, about a mile away, in early July.
Lastly, some direct quotes from my grandparents. They frequently send me cards with small enclosed checks.
Enjoy a pizza on us!
Try a Pizza Hut Priazzo on us!
Enjoy a pizza on us!
Have a great pizza dinner on us!
I am the world’s worst grandson, I admit it.
Dear Brian: A little spending money.
Brian dear: Here is a little spending money.
Brian dear: Here is a small check for a little spending money.
Well, I have become totally insecure about sending you anything. I am afraid that I will betray the truth about myself and you will be disenchanted. I send this anyway. It’s my own stupid fault. Hope you like it. See you soon…
love
Brian








June 27, 1989 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Miss,
I have been home two days. My room is a mess; I haven’t unpacked yet from the weekend. It’s a struggle to get to work before 11:00 and when I come home I watch TV, play with the kittens, and try to fall asleep before 2:00. I need new clothes, my jeans are in threads, but I wear them anyway. I am good at my job and work hard at it. Sometimes I submerge myself in it out of a desire to escape the neglected state of the rest of my life, I think. Work is one of the few places where I can make sense to myself.
It was good to see you this weekend. The wedding was fun, like an extended inside joke. I’m glad we spent so much time together, it was what I wanted to do. I am sorry Saturday night turned out the way it did. Saying goodbye to you like it was nothing felt like shit. Perhaps it was just a bad night, or the effects of seeing so much of each other in a short time, or all that driving in Pete’s car, or the fact that we slept while you called us. I have taking to calling that evening FOUR EGOS AND A CAR.
I have been toying with the idea that it is healthy to disregard the things that happened. That it is immature and counter-productive to dwell on events that I do not understand. That my obsession with clarity leads only to the next bit of confusion. That maybe your letter is in the mail and I am making a big deal of nothing. That you are not worth the effort, that I should simply look elsewhere. That it is my loneliness and nothing to do with you.
Yet it is 1:30 in the morning and I am not paying my bills or doing the laundry or any of the ten thousand other things that functional adults do with their time. I don’t know why I am driven to write this or to sit under streetlights and refuse to move. Experience has shown that it is fruitless or worse. But to do otherwise is self-betrayal, which I loathe.
It is scary to care about you as much as I do. We have little in common and not even a real rapport. My parents think I am simply hooked on troublesome relationships. Still I think of you as one of my closest friends. I don’t know why. Isn’t that fucked?
I am not sure if I have the ability to reach you in any real way, to touch you without recourse to wit or intellectual dialog. I am not sure even if that is something you’d want. I wish we had continued that conversation about conversations in the car.
All I know is that I am upset and sad and have been for several days. Whatever the stupid reason. Even Friday night after I dropped you off, I came back to my folks’ house and it was empty and I did not understand what had happened that evening. It is a sadness that piles up on itself for being sad.
Anyway, I was wondering what you thought about all this.
love truly,
Brian


This was written just after Marcia’s wedding. My only memory of that weekend now is Peter wanting you, me, Holly, and him to get stoned in his car, and me thinking to myself that it was a bad idea (mainly because we weren’t teenagers any more and hadn’t seen each other in years).
The “sit under streetlights and refuse to move” line refers to the time I was mugged by two drunk townies while I sat sadly outside Sue Dimmock’s house at about 1:00 am, a few weeks before the wedding.
Aside from the fact that it’s 100% depressing, this is a decent letter, but I didn’t send it until December.




July 21, 1989 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Missy,
Write me a letter; tell me what happened the weekend I was there. I am sorry things turned out strangely. I’m not even really sure what happened. The next day I was very sad and tried to tell myself that it was just a bad night. I wish we hadn’t got stoned. The whole weekend confused me. Marcia lives here now – they are looking for a house. I would like to work things out with you. Is it worth it? I ask that question a lot these days. Tell Holly I’m sorry, too.
love
Brian

A month later, I was still thinking about the wedding weekend, but I didn’t send this letter to you until September.

September 5, 1989 – From Melissa
 


You moved to California, so once again we were thousands of miles apart.


September 8, 1989 – From Brian
Dear Missy,
You’re going to grad school in Monterey, CA. OK. Sounds like a nice place. Go crazy. Translate like mad.
Marcia lives here now. I went to her place once, and we talked some about what it would be like if we were married. It was cool, actually. I think she understands more about herself than we sometimes figure. Of course, I haven’t heard from her in about two months. Not sure why exactly. I am incapable of figuring these things out right, so I cultivate my detachment. Getting pretty good. Lots of practice recently.
Interviewed someone at work today for about an hour and a half. It’s great fun to interview, if it goes well. This is what work is like these days: One of the receptionists and I have gotten bored with flirting and have stopped. A friend, colleague, whatever, invited me to a barbeque this weekend. Always strange to invite some people but not others. Pretty crowded place. See the same people every day. Almost all men. Go out for lunch every day. Find it impossible to work more than six or seven hours a day. Of which, maybe one is actually productive. There are sudden bursts of creativity, though. It’s just impossible to foresee or plan them. A woman friend asked me to a concert, and I said yes even though it’s FINE YOUNG CANNIBALS. She is really cool, but I don’t know if it’s a date or what. Like I said, I am incapable of figuring out these situations. Let alone what’s in her mind, I have no idea what’s in mine. Sometimes I am pretty sure that I just want to sleep with everyone. Anyway, more opportunity for cultivating. Does this mean anything to you? I dread writing boring letters, but I’ve got to talk about something besides Marcia and what a degenerate Peter is.
I was pretty bitter that last night in VA. You are impossible to reach. I don’t think you want to be reached. It must bore you to tears waiting for me to say something witty. I assume you realize that I am pretty crazy about you most of the time we’re together. When things are going well, anyway. I just have no idea what I’m doing.
My arm is killing me. I tore my rotator cuff last weekend body surfing in the ocean, so I hope you can read this. Maybe I will copy it over later on. I have to keep picking my hand up and moving it across the paper. Hurts like a motherfucker unless I am watching TV or otherwise vegging out.
I don’t mean to piss you off. You don’t strike me as someone who appreciates curiosity or prodding. Which are my specialties when I’m not being hilarious. I don’t believe in being funny anymore. I believe in music and love and relentlessness. What do you believe in? To be honest, I was surprised to hear from you. I almost sent you a letter a few weeks ago, but that’s when it occurred to me that it wasn’t going to help to ask you to justify yourself to me. Write me back a real letter and tell me something that will help.
love,
Brian
P.S. I am enclosing that letter from July for its historical value if nothing else.




December 17, 1989 – From Brian


This is when I sent the letter from June. You were busy starting a new life, but I didn’t want to let you go entirely.
1990
November 29, 1990 – From Melissa
Dear Brian Berns,
Don’t ask me why I haven’t written you in literally years. Obviously I have thought about writing you because here I am, finally doing it. Don’t ask me why you sent me cryptic, wistful, almost reproachful letters. Which are very difficult to answer, I might add. Maybe now you will get this and at least register that I want to try. Try what, I don’t know exactly. I know how badly you already hate dealing with this “relationship based on writing.” But don’t you agree that it’s better than none at all? Now that we have experienced both, what is your judgement?
Anyway, I hope you are still at this same address. If not, I hope you get your forwarded mail and read it. I just hope I can still get through to you somehow, because I really want to. It seems ridiculous to think we may never communicate again, much less see each other again. I do want to see you again. I know it is unlikely that we could get together for more than much of a vacation, but that would also be a nice thing. To see each other on a vacation, that is.
Anyway, as you see, this letter is coming to you from California, where I’m living. I’m going to school at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, which you have probably never heard of. It only has 600 students. And there are a few programs: the big one is an MBA in international business. That’s not the program I’m in, by the way. I am getting my Master’s next year in Translation and Interpretation (of German). It’s the only program in America for that. A serious big deal. Anyway, I’m supposed to graduate, but in all truth I haven’t yet started my thesis. Hopefully I’ll get a lot of that done in January….
California is actually a cool place to live – and I came here with all my preconceptions and prejudices and every second phrase out of my mouth was “I’m from the East Coast.” I have it pretty good. My school is in Monterey, where the air smells like the sea and you can hear the sea lions barking from the classrooms. I live in Carmel, where I basically house-sit and garden for a very good rent deal. The house is 3 blocks from the beach. At the beginning of the semester I went there a lot more. I used to go running along the ocean in the mornings before class (the only way I could wake up for the 8:00 ones), but then I got more or less swamped with work as well as riddled with illness. Now I’m healthy and ready for the final round, so to speak. I have another month, then 1 month vacation. I’ve been here since last September. I applied for the program at the end of July (at the last minute, per usual) and was accepted with three weeks to prepare for the move out west. I have only been home since for the total of 1 week: 3 days in the spring on my way to Switzerland for an internship, and 3 days on the way back. On the way back I saw Holly for the first time in over a year. I drove for 2 hours to Fredericksburg and she drove up from Richmond and we met in a Bob’s Big Boy and talked non-stop, high-speed for 3 hours. A short fix. She showed me pictures of her 8-month cross-country vacation/eco-spree of the U.S. I won’t see her again until April. At her wedding. She and Dave are getting married in Richmond. This time a wedding that will be a joyous occasion. I guess you never met Dave. I think you would approve. I do. They’ve been together for 5 years. Or so. Right now I am trying to scrape up enough money to go to Richmond in April for the wedding. I can’t miss it: it’s the wedding of the century that I can’t miss. They told me anyway that I am the guest of honor. Dave said, “So Melissa are you going to show up at the wedding we’re throwing for you?”
Now it is post-telephone conversation with you. I just ate fried rice and am smoking a cigarette and watching a movie called “[?],” which Michael and Amy brought home. Michael lives in this house with Chi-Ho, who is my good friend here at school. Chi-Ho is the boyfriend of my last year roommate, Lisa. Lisa is spending the year in China, which is sad for me (and for Chi-Ho). I especially miss her. I was very happy living in the house with her. Usually I didn’t get so famously along with my female roommates while they were my roommates. Afterwards, when we were friends, it went OK again. So Chi-Ho is leaving, too, after the semester. Sad for me because he is my favorite playmate here at school. I also have a friend, Lara, whom I do things with sometimes. But her boyfriend is moving here in December, so I’m sure she’ll be even less accessible than she is now. My other friend, Benita (who has waistlength red hair), can only be taken in smaller doses. Brilliant but deadly – or shall I say acerbic. Most of the rest of the students at school are basically the throwaway model. A large contingent is the league of international assholes. 40% of the students are international. OK, so they’re not that bad. But we just can’t relate, see? I’m not sure which are more fascinating – more significant to my scientific studies – the Europeans in the American setting or the Americans trying to show how European they are.
I guess I wasn’t surprised to hear that you and Peter aren’t getting along great. You were sort of off again, on again before. Do you know why it is? I’m sure you would say, oh it’s much too complicated to explain, or that it’s something deep-seated or something organic, or maybe you would say you’d analyzed it but your findings are all bullshit anyway. But I think you must know and understand. Do you at least think it’s something to be grown out of? To tell the truth, I very seldom, almost never, think about Peter. I’m not sure why. Maybe it’s what the Germans call “vergangenheitsbewältigung,” which translates lamely as “coming to terms with the past.”
Well, Brian, this is the end of your free gift letter. I hope you do like it. I hope you do write back. I hope you don’t try to aim for my track record. My address:

November 30, 1990 – From Brian
Nov. 30, 1990
Missy (Melissa),
Well, no, actually: Peter is pretty easy to explain. At least the reason I’m sick of him is. (It’s the reasons I love him that are so deep-seated and organic.) A while ago at the beginning of the summer or so he blows into town with this hippy-chick entourage and the Grateful Dead are playing the next day and etc. So it was supposedly a “surprise visit” or something but he ends up calling me from somewhere because he doesn’t have the slightest clue how to get here. Anyway they get here and unload all their fucking sleeping bags and backpacks and bongs and the first thing he starts telling me how lame my life is and how free and pure his is. I mean, he may be right [about my life], but it was simply impossible and disgusting to listen to, him blabbing away with his shitting smile drooling hypocrisy down onto the floor into my house.
Then, get this, they go to the concert and whatever and now it’s Sunday morning at like 10:00 am and I am sound sound asleep when the doorbell rings and it is the Federal Express man with a package for Peter, who has already packed up the entire hippy-chick operation and is halfway to the next Dead gig, which is, I believe, in Buffalo. So I signed for the package and I figure since I signed for it, I can open it. Inside is this note in 6th-grade English which reads basically “here’s all I could get, I’ll owe you the rest” and a quarter-inch wad of bills. The first four bills are fifties, and I was really worried until I saw that the last thirty-five bills were only twenties. Four fifties and 35 twenties in this Fed Ex package which says in big black letters on the side: “DO NOT SEND CASH.” So then, of course, I start getting these messages from him, constantly, at home and at work. Somehow God is blessing me and I’m never actually around when he calls, so it is just messages and messages. It was great, with each passing hour, it seemed, his messages became more blunt and specific about how he needed his money. About how he needed me to go to the Fed Ex “store” and send his money to such-and-such address before such-and-such time, otherwise he would wither up and die. Until, after maybe two days, I find myself walking through Boston with sweaty palms and $900 looking for the Fed Ex store which I knew was around there someplace. I found it. He had instructed me to subtract the cost of shipping it from the stack, but I didn’t want any of his fucking drug money, so I sent it all and I have not heard from him since.

Dec. 9
So that’s the Peter story. He left a message for me yesterday asking if I’d be home for Christmas. I called him back today and we had a good conversation, so now I feel guilty about what I’ve written about his visit. Are you coming home for the holidays? I forget if you mentioned it when we talked. I should be there for a few days, at least. Speaking of which, I should be in San Jose for a few weeks in February and March. Is that anywhere near you?
I’ve had the hardest time with this letter, Miss. I wrote a few pages that came from the heart but made no sense. Plus I was drunk for some of them, and just couldn’t send it as is. I’ve thought and thought, but I can’t seem to come to grips with all this. It’s not just you – I have no normal dealings with anyone, especially people I’ve known a long time. But with you, does it make a difference? Will we ever be together long enough to stand or fall on our own merits?
love
Brian

The notorious “hippy-chick” letter. What a revolting experience. (Please do not show him the letter.)
If you look at the scan below, you can see where I carefully tore the paper to redact the rest of what I had written.







November 30, 1990 – From Brian (cont’d, unsent)
So that’s why I’m sick of Peter. Please excuse my handwriting, by the way, as I have been drinking tequila and lemonade the last page or so. And now I am quite buzzed.
Now it is 2:30 in the morning and I am torn. I had all these things to say: about Marcia, about Sue who you may or may not remember, about working all the time and becoming an incredible nerd until at the end of the day I drive home thinking nerd thoughts, reviewing the nerd humor I have shared with my friends all the live-long day. And when I get home I turn on the computer and work some more, because I am committed and, for some reason, care about my work just about more than anything else in my life. But this whole Peter thing took a lot out of me, writing it all down, so I am left here listening to George Winston, wishing I had a cigarette, wondering if it is too late California-time to call you, realizing that I have nothing to say except I had this scab and it was healing quite nicely and then you called and now I am thinking about you all the time again. I am sorry to have written you reproachful letters. It’s just that I feel connected to you more deeply than I can possibly justify, and I will do anything I can to force you to help me understand what’s going on in my mind.
Well, shit, I doubt this makes any sense at all. I will try again tomorrow when I am sober and I am not so upset.

December 2, 1990
OK, here’s the Marica story. I’m going to make it short because four more pages will wipe me out: Oh fuck it, it’s not worth it; here’s the point: she lives a mile from here and she is always busy. Every couple of weeks or so, she has an hour free and she fits me into her schedule for a walk or a chat. I’m not conveying it well here, but trust me, it’s pretty tedious. And the Sue story boils down to this: Here’s a woman I have known seven years who lives about three miles away and one day I call her to wish her [a] happy birthday but she’s not home so I leave my name. Then, perhaps three weeks later, she leaves a message on our machine in which she gives her full name (first and last) and has nothing to say but “since you called me first, you can just call me back.” It had been so long that I didn’t even remember why I called the first time until after I called again and we waded through a most awkward conversation. The whole time it was clear she didn’t want to talk to me and I was just thinking, almost out loud, What is the fucking POINT of this!?
So the common thread here (besides the fact that I’ll apparently complain about anything) is these people are all old friends about whom I have felt passionately, and occasionally felt nothing at all. There have been long silences and intense reunions and, let me tell you, by now I simply have no clue whatsoever about any of it. None. I give up.
Well, at least I have cigarettes now. It’s been two days since I wrote pp. 1-4 and now it is Sunday night at 1:20 am and I am fading fast. Another long day of doing nothing. I’ve debated whether to keep that drunken part at the end. Usually I wouldn’t, but what the heck. I’m tempted to try to explain that last sentence (“It’s just that…”), but I don’t really have the energy and if I don’t just wrap this up and mail it tomorrow, I’m afraid I never will. So, this is me, wrapping it up in a rather incomplete-feeling way. I’m never done with anything.
love
Brian

The first part of this is the redacted portion of the hippy-chick letter, and the second half is an attempt to finish the letter organically a few days later. Reading it now, I think it’s actually pretty good, but I couldn’t bear to send it to you at the time, when you had just contacted me out of the blue and triggered many old feelings.







1991
January 14, 1991 – From Melissa
Dear Brian Berns,
I got your letter. I guess that was before Christmas. Now I am at work and I’m watching Sesame Street with Julia Roberts on it. Work can be fun, you see. I have to work 9 to 5, which is a normal day at most jobs but here it is interminable – even though the nice thing about it is there’s little to nothing to do, the bad thing about it is the same. It is death by boredom. Usually I spend the time reading the paper, from which I move on to the Economist or the New Yorker (I have subscriptions to those), to writing letters, to watching t.v. I probably could have written my entire thesis in the work time, but I haven’t been so enterprising. School starts again next Tuesday, however, so I must get on the ball. My plan was to have a final draft done by then as well as the usual resumé/cover letter garbage.
I’ve been having a pretty rotten break, actually. For various reasons. First off, exams were even more hellish than I had imagined. Usually I hold out pretty well because I have the right temperament. I get nervous and edgy but I do pretty well under stress and I get over it very quickly. I usually can release the tension, unlike many other people who seem to keep it inside and suffer unspeakable torments (and who will later certainly develop ulcers). But this time I was a wreck by the end of the 8 tests (in 7 days). I didn’t care any more at all and knew somehow that the grandiose plans we had of getting irrevocably, disgustingly and quite wonderfully drunk wasted would not work out. I knew we wouldn’t be able to have fun, and no one did. Then it was just a few days before Christmas, and of course I wasn’t at all in the mood. I couldn’t make myself wrap presents or send any cards. I didn’t even feel like going to my brother’s. I just wished it were all over with – it seemed like so much effort. Then I found out my brother was in the hospital, which is another long story. Neither he nor I were in very good spirits at all. I stayed a few days with him, came back to work 1 day, went back for 2 days, then was here. New Year’s Eve was better than could be expected. The very best part was with my friend Lara. She and I were at our mutual friends Benita and Holly’s house. (I had been staying there and it is right in the center of town), sitting outside on the steps, chainsmoking, drinking the bottle of vodka she’d brought with gingerale, and talking for hours. We had such a wonderful time talking that we lost track of the time and forgot to go out until after 10:30. Then we went to our regular bar – the Monterey Brewing Company. They have good beer and live bands but it’s not too exciting just because basically it’s the only place we ever go. So the charm has worn off. Also, about 90% of the time we go, the same band is playing that night. “Alligator.” It’s a good band and they do Cajun-Zydeco-rock music and I know their repertoire by heart and all the band members personally and Lara’s boyfriend, Felix, is the rhythm guitar player. But old hat is old hat, is it not?
ANYWAY. That was the month of December. January has ranged from being uneventful to being somber, bleak and fraught with soul-searching and self-deprecation. I’m just coming out of this cycle, however – as the mere fact that I am able to write this letter attests. With one week left to find all the answers (!!!), I think a new life may begin….
Because I did a lot of things between the time I started that last explanation and the end of the paragraph, I am not quite sure if I left anything out or began any digressions that need finishing. But I’m too lazy to read back over what I wrote just yet, so let me continue as my mind or pen would have it.
C-SPAN is having a quorum call so some violin concerto is playing. At least it’s live. I just hope that no news of Iraqi attacks or Israeli retaliations is suddenly broadcast on all T.V. stations because my state of mind as well as the state of the world are unfit to deal with that. Today, driving to work on Highway 1, I passed a pick-up truck parked along the shoulder. It had a sign attached to its roof which read: “The rich start it. The poor fight it. And the young die for it.” Without really registering it, I started to cry behind the wheel of my car. Do you think the Deadheads in the midst of their drug deals and bead jewelry/batik sheet sales sit around and bum out about the state of world affairs? Do they discuss the Middle Eastern mindset, the defense budget and weigh the probability of conflict vs. diplomatic mechanisms being successful? And how does Peter Fiori fit into it all?
Your explanation of the Peter story (visit to Boston, hippie-chicks in your living room, violations of Federal Express regulations) actually rather saddened me. I hope he turns out ok. I am trying not to be a judgmental snob as I write this, by the way. I know I have no right to judge the chosen paths of others. Maybe he is doing the only morally/metaphysically “right” thing. Maybe he is a human who is remaining completely true to himself… But in terms of my current grasp of the world and the way things work, I can only muster up a bit of anxiety for him. Then I think (and I’m not being condescending), “it’s ok, he’s young and has time.” (The end of that sentence, which you’ll notice I didn’t add, would read “to straighten up.” It’s not that I advocate he become an investment banker or anything – but I remember being pleased to hear that he was liking school before, that he had interest and passion for theater, that he was studying philosophy.) I just hope he doesn’t get caught up in something that he finds it hard to get out of if he decides he’s had enough…
I talked to Holly last night. She is making wedding plans. It actually sounds like an amazingly cool wedding. As weddings go. I think you’ll like Dave. They are both applying to be park rangers. Maybe a year-long job. Then they want to go to grad school eventually, maybe build/buy a place in the country.
The fact is, now I’m running out of energy and think it might be time to mail this letter. I hope it’s not too gloomy for you. But what matters gloom when supported by sincerity? Please write back. I don’t care what you write or the tone/degree of cheerfulness. I just want to hear what your life consists of, what you have been thinking.
Take care.
Love, Melissa
















January 18, 1991 – From Brian
Dear Melissa (Missy),
It is 1:30 am Friday morning. I have been meaning to buy cat litter the last two days, to no avail. Every day after work there is this war all evening, which is causing my house to start to smell like stale cat shit. Work itself is a constant struggle for sanity, a battle between dedication to my tasks and my colleagues (I hate that word, but what is better?) and the absurdity of the pressures on us to meet certain deadlines and adapt to what my office-mate calls the “requirement du jour” from our unpredictable client, IBM. The mood swings are constant and exhausting: a successful morning of creativity and concentration leaves me wide open to depressing news or annoying assholes in the afternoon. The temptation to just give up is very strong and we flirt with it half-jokingly more and more every day, but it would mean betrayal and mutiny.
And, now, when I sit at my desk and stare out the window looking for inspiration from the perseverance of others, all I find [are] reports of men who have never met, hurling metal at each other from great distances.
All of which leaves me here at 2:00 am now feeling wired and I think “conflicted” is the appropriate pop-psychology word. (I love “co-dependent” too, by the way, but I have to admit that it doesn’t apply here.) I know that by allowing all this to churn around inside me I am virtually destroying any chance to wake up tomorrow fresh and sharp and somewhat more together, but I have decided to indulge myself in the interests of my spiritual and epistolary (look that one up) needs.
I came home today after two or three hours of really productive work, and three or four of defiant games of Space Invaders and alternating doses of Hüsker Dü and NPR on my Walkman. The drive home was made tedious by protesters who had poured into the streets. Marcia had left a message on my machine saying that she cannot meet me for lunch Friday due to an emergency faculty meeting to discuss the reaction of her school’s students to the outbreak of war. (CBS, by the way, continues to refer to it as a “showdown” in their slick little graphical intro segment. I think they are, however, referring to the UN forces as “The Coalition” rather than “The Allies”, which really is pretty musty-sounding. Not only that, but I think it was on CBS that I heard speculation that Turkey might “cross across and attack Iraq”, which I thought was really brilliantly phrased. I love the linguistics of the whole thing.) Anyway, Marcia’s marriage is apparently nearly over, so I started thinking that maybe I’ll finally get her to go to bed with me. Then I saw your letter sitting on the table and felt a familiar bit of instant palm-sweating. It was clear that I did not just then have the energy to open and read your letter, so I picked up the newspaper (which read in the tallest letters I’ve ever seen in The Boston Globe, “War Breaks Out in Persian Gulf”, or something like that) and began looking for the comics. My roommate Evan had CNN on, and nearly immediately there are these pictures from Tel Aviv of people in a tiny room – the anchor is urging the on-screen “correspondent” to put on his gas mask. Panic exudes from all the networks as Evan operates the remote control. My mind is full of the need for cat litter. I must leave to purchase cat litter, but Israel is under attack and I must stay to watch. Minutes pass. The endless coverage of non-events interspersed with occasional bits of actual news is excruciating. They are showing a car driving down a street at night. It is not news, it is a car driving down the street, but my heart is pounding. Everyone is waiting. The reporter’s gas mask is not on quite right, but he refuses to fix it, preferring to stare at the camera out of his left eye. I realize that I cannot take another hour of this, let alone several more weeks. Your letter is sitting in my lap, and I decide to open it, hoping it will relax me or center me or something. What is that word? “Quorum”? It appears to be “quorum”, I decide. I am deciphering your handwriting with fanatical desperation. I am chewing through your letter with my eyes.
So now it’s 3:00 am. I have written all this in one spurt, and am wide-awake and starving and exhausted. I wish I was drunk. You ask me to write about my life, regardless of my tone, but I find that I cannot simply report on my thoughts without an image of you in my mind reading these words. That is the hard part: Letting this desire I have to communicate with you drive me to write this letter with an almost embarrassing urgency, but suspecting all the time that you are not interested in the desire, but merely the letter it produced.
love
Brian

I’m proud of this one. It’s a good “story” letter that effectively captures the zeitgeist, and it ends with a personal thought that seems insightful.









February 3, 1991 – From Melissa
Dear Brian, 
About 2 days ago I typed in “dear Brian” at the top of this page but that was as far as I got with the letter. It was after I had already spent about 3 or 4 hours working on a translation into German so I was pretty spent. This, by the way, is my brand-new computer. It has an exciting VGA color monitor and my friend helped me negotiate the deal on it at the big store in the heart of Silicon Valley where everyone, absolutely everyone, buys their computers, software, peripherals, plotters, you name it, around here. It was a bargain, and he told them not to put the DOS in, but they did anyway for some reason so I saved $80 on that. Then he copied all his software for me, the most fun of which is rolex, and the bonus is that I have a thesaurus and spell-check in German as well as in English. If only I had a German grammar-check. But I don’t have a printer, so I have to print out everything at the school computer room. Bummer. Just recently I got my first credit card ever, so I think I am probably going to just buy one anyway and pay somehow later. One always imagines or hopes one will have more money in the future, at a date to later be determined.
Anyway, now it is Friday evening and I am tired and world-weary and not in the least bit excited about driving up to Mountain View tomorrow (3 hours round trip) to work the entire day, especially since no matter how hard I study tonight or how much I accomplish, I will still have the spend the entire day Sunday catching up, not to mention Monday. I can’t believe how incredibly laden with work I am, what with the semester just having started. I don’t mind the work or the actual assignments: I actually enjoy them, but not having enough time to do them to the best of my ability disturbs me. And the truth is, I’ve done nothing but work more diligently than I ever have. Last weekend I didn’t go out once, and this weekend will be the same. I don’t even have a desire to go out with others I know who are hosting barbecues or going to restaurants for dinner. Maybe I am starting to worry that I am becoming a maladjusted hermit. Living alone makes everything seem a bit out of perspective sometimes.
Now I just put music on, which makes everything seem a little bit more workable. In fact, I just started smiling and humming. You won’t believe this, Brian, but I am applying for a job at a software company as a localization expert and if I got the job I would have to learn Unix as well as all about their alpha and beta software, things which are a great mystery to me. But maybe I will go to Germany instead, or even Switzerland, which is much nicer, somehow so less German. The politics are basically boring and eternally unchanging, but you don’t feel so much like a foreigner there. Everyone seems to be one there. And it pleases the Swiss a great deal that they can understand what the Germans say, but that the Germans can’t understand them. Ha ha, those kooky Swiss. So, as you can imagine, I’ve been going through resume hell for a couple of weeks now, and this weekend, until I’ve penned the dreaded cover letter, I’ll be living in cover letter hell. I hate self-packaging.
Meanwhile, yes, there is a war on and from time to time I turn on the TV again, I guess in the hope that the nation has suddenly acquired some wisdom and is not just hanging on the words of some expert or tuning in to see what the score is, but every time I am disappointed. Today, at work in the Media Center (where either CNN or the foreign satellite news is always on) I realized that Bush looked smilier than ever. Since the war broke out, he has been smilier than in the whole rest of his time in office. I bet he sleeps well at night.

February 16, 1991
This letter lived for weeks in my bag, intact but unmailed. Things are about the same. School, school, school. How is Marcia doing, anyway? Is it still as bad as you said? How much do you see her? So, maybe you got an invitation to Holly’s wedding by now. I sent her your address a while ago. Will you go?
I guess I should just end this now before my distraction gets only worse and just ends up embarrassing me.
Write soon, OK?
Melissa

A few weeks after this, my employer offered to transfer me to one of their other offices, two of which happened to be in Rockville and Silicon Valley. I arranged to interview in CA first, where I saw you. We then flew back across the country at the same time (but not together) to Holly’s wedding in DC, where I had another interview. We had a good time together in CA (I think), but the wedding wasn’t as pleasant.



April 29, 1991 – From Brian
Dear Melissa,
I hope your exams are going well. I left the wedding about a half an hour after you. Holly said, “I understand” when I left. Today I spent interviewing again, this time in Rockville. At this point, I have no clue what I’m going to do. I got back a couple of hours ago – the cabbie and I talked about Boston driving all the way back, so it felt like I was coming home, but not as much as I would have liked. It seemed like I had been gone for weeks and weeks when I finally opened my front door – the cats gave me a long hard look before admitting they knew me. I called Marcia. She asked what color your hair was and is busy every day this week except for a couple hours Saturday afternoon for which I was penciled in. I called Peter. His phone has been “temporarily disconnected” according [to] the message supplied by the phone company. You couldn’t make shit up this good. Just thought you’d like to know.
So that was the chitchat part of the letter. Not even very interesting chitchat, I have to admit. Upcoming is the part which explains why I have been wanting to write you since about 6:00 pm Sunday when you probably hadn’t even made it back to I-95 yet. Let me preface this part by saying that you have been not more than a moment away from my thoughts since we sat down in Tillie Gort’s in Monterey, CA Thursday night. A very pleasant and somewhat overwhelming state of mind to be in, although I did have a little trouble concentrating on my interview today. It seemed not quite so important compared to some of the things that had come up over the weekend. So, anyway, the thing that I am curious about is this. (“Curious” is the strongest word I can use in light of your assertion that my overall insecurity about things is not nece[ssary].) I know that you were very busy Sunday with the wedding and worrying about your flight back, so I understand why you did not have much time to spend with me. What I don’t understand is why, during the few minutes we did spend together, you felt the need to shut me out quite so completely. I’m pretty sure I’m not imagining it, though I admit that as a possibility. I have a guess, but I’d rather hear what you have to say.
love
Brian

My memories of this bicoastal adventure are vague. I mainly remember the feeling of whiplash – that we had a nice time together in CA and then, to my surprise, you were very distant at Holly’s wedding (even though you had specifically asked me to go with you and seemed to be looking forward to it).
The job offered to me in the California office seemed interesting, so I transferred there in early July. This was a major turning point in my life.



Summer 1991 – From Holly and Dave
   

I included this for additional context (and because it’s so weird that Holly didn’t know how she met me!?)


September 15, 1991 – From Brian


I drove down to see you once in Monterey shortly after I moved to California. It was an awkward visit, and I could tell you didn’t really want me there, but I didn’t understand why.
December 14, 1991 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Missy,
I am sorry that you have been so busy since, oh, the summer. I am trying to believe that one person could possibly have so little free time, but I’m having a problem with the basic lameness of it. Perhaps you could help me by telling me what is going on? If there is some reason you simply don’t want to see me. I would hope that after so long I would merit at least a cursory dismissal rather than this absurd nonsense. Seeing you is like trying to get an audience with the fucking Pope.
I’m sure that whatever is on your mind, it doesn’t actually have anything to do with me, but that hardly justifies this kind of treatment. You’ve been little but weird to me since the day of Holly’s wedding, and I don’t know why. I care so much about you, it really hurts to think that I have to put up with this abuse as a result.
I’m sorry for this – letters like this have too many occurrences of the word “I”. For instance: I’m afraid that by writing you this way, I will only make things worse, but I don’t know what else to do. Honestly, I have no desire to pressure or, as I think you once put it, “reproach” you, but you are really confusing me. If that means anything or matters at all to you, please do something constructive of your choice.
love, Brian

Context, from a letter I wrote to Marcia in January 1992:
Early November [1991] I am in Boston, [Melissa] calls for me. Upon my return I call her back and she invites me to her house for Thanksgiving, but I have plans to go to D.C. After Thanksgiving I call her and she invites me down for the day Saturday. Saturday morning I rise to find that she has already called. I return her call. She has had an awful week and is exhausted – don’t come down this weekend. OK, I say, in my bewilderment, how about next weekend? She is unsure, and asks me to call again towards the end of the week. I do – she is exhausted again and asks that I not come. Look, I say, can I just come and talk to you for like a half hour? She guess so and asks me to call again the next day. I do – she is really exhausted, please don’t come. I am, well, what am I? Somewhere past shocked, well into serious disbelief. I write her a letter but do not send it (yet). Go figure.



December 15, 1991 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Missy,
Look, I’m sorry things have gotten this way. I only wanted to talk with you for a few minutes, but now I’m afraid that I am simply pressuring you (or, as I think you once put it, “reproaching” you) somehow. I honestly don’t want to do that, but I didn’t know what else to do but try to see you. Things have been weird between us since the day of Holly’s wedding, and I don’t know why. What is going on with you? Please let me know if you can. What is going on with me is massive confusion and teeth gnashing, which is no fun at all. I care so much about you, it really hurts to think that this silence is a result.
love, Brian

I tried to write you again the next day, after I had calmed down a bit, but still didn’t send it. One of the reasons I left Boston was to break away from an unrequited relationship, so I was determined not to repeat that pattern with you.

January 2, 1992 – From Brian
Dear Missy,
I am sorry if I have pissed you off somehow? Have I? I would rather see you than not see you, if that is still an option. For a small fee I might even regale you with stories from my recent visits to the East Coast even.
I’ll also have you know that this is the third time I’ve attempted a letter to you. 3. OK? (That’s 7 metric letters). Plus all that teeth-gnashing and staring blankly into space wondering what to say. Man-months of teeth-gnashing and staring.
Please respond. I’m pretty sure it’s worth it.
love, Brian

Feb. 2, 1992
A month of occasional pondering has not produced a better letter than this one (surprisingly enough), so I am sending it. I am not prepared to forget that I know you, if that’s what I’m supposed to do.
Brian


February 11, 1992 – From Brian
Dear Missy,
Peter worries a lot about me becoming normal. This concern takes a variety of forms, usually centering around my reluctance to get high on a moment’s notice or his fear that since I have some sort of corporate job that I pack it in at 9:30 every night, making it impossible to place those late-night long-distance calls that friends (one of whom does not write) must subsist on when separated.
I, however, have no concerns anymore about becoming normal (I guess maybe there was a time in Boston when it was sort of vaguely possible. Not really though.) For instance, I was up until 4:00 am yesterday compiling all letters sent to or written by me (that I was smart enough to xerox first) from 1986 to the present. I still have 1981-1985 in piles on my floor. It was amazing. At about 10:00 pm, after having been holed up in my room all day doing this, I wandered out to find my housemates lodged in front of the TV. I joined them and the expressed the standard statements that are made to someone who has been holed up all day. I explained that I had been putting all my letters in three-ring binders, and had much more to do. You have to understand that at this point I was flushed with pride over this incredible collection that was mine; that was about me and by me and pretty much defined everything I’ve been in the last decade. You also have to understand that my housemates, who are substantially wonderful, are also among the most eccentrically normal people I know (e.g. they eat fondue on a regular basis), so when Cindy looked at me a little strangely and asked “You keep every letter someone sends to you?” I knew again that I am not normal.
Anyway, so today it was Monday and I was a zero at work due to lack of sleep. The plan was to come home and go to sleep early in order to make up for this tomorrow, but after several hours in bed, not sleeping, (listening to the Larry King Show, actually), it is now 1:00 am and I have spent the better part of the last hour leafing through this just-collected body of work with joy and wonderment. I even found a letter that I wrote to my friend Lisa that may actually be better than the famous party letter.
I have, in fact, just been reading through the slew of letters you sent me at the beginning part of your year in Germany, and am so full of thoughts about you that this letter became imperative, even if it is a breach of protocol at this point. I even have your writing style coming out of my fingers (ok, just a little, I admit). I am, in fact, at this very moment, using your own writing style against you in order to persuade you that I am not sort of SCARY DUDE hellbent on harassing you about things and otherwise providing you with copious discomfort. That I am not the sort of person who would show up unannounced at your door some Friday evening when you have just come home from work and are not interested in anything. (Yes, I have thought rather frequently about doing more-or-less just that, but have managed to restrain myself somehow. In fact I talked to Peter last night and he is probably coming out here in the medium-term future, and I think it’s only fair to warn you that unless you write me or call me REAL SOON, such a visit from the both of us together is probably inevitable, given the nature of things and such.)
I have a letter from you from 1982 that is amazing. Maybe I will xerox a copy for you with this letter. In 1982 I was unable to discern anything about anything, but you were sending me amazing letters. Go figure.
So let me point out now that it is coming up on a year since Holly and Dave were wed. That for the first time in years we live near each other. That since my arrival here in the beautiful Bay area I have seen you exactly once. I really miss you and it kills me to think that soon you might leave for Europe again or get married without me or something, and we will have blown it.
love, Brian

I was subletting a small room from a couple who lived in a ranch house in Los Altos. They were probably the white bread-iest people I’ve ever known.
I did eventually show up unannounced at the door of your new home (without Peter), in a last-ditch effort to save our relationship, but you turned me away.
When I sent this, I included an old letter from July 1988 with the following annotation: “Ok, now it is 2:45 am and I am still reading. I can’t stop. There are many letters I wrote but was afraid to send and this is one of them. Now it is yours.”
Helen and I started dating shortly after this letter was written.







 
August 19, 1992 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Missy,
My life here is pretty good, if you’re interested. I seem to have some of the fundamentals down and am occasionally able to work on my style. Not hearing from you, however, makes me sad occasionally*. And at times like this when I have the freedom to concentrate on your withdrawal (again) from my life there are also tinges of desperation, frustration, anger, bewilderment, etc. that lead to no plausible course of action.
Pretend I am thick-headed and have not picked up the subtle message inherent in your silence. Educate me. Enlighten me. Take** Have pity on me, for crissake, if that’s what it takes.
love
Brian
* Didn’t realize I already used this word once. Substitute a synonym of your choice.
** Same mistake
P.S. I bought a Fairport Convention album, but it was only so-so. What’s the best one to get?


October 20, 1992 – From Brian (undelivered)
Dear Missy, 
What's up with you, anyway? This is my occasional background thought of you that never changes. Once every couple of days like some sort of small chronic disease – my eyesight dims when the temperature is divisible by 9, or something — that I got from you. What the fuck happened? Sometimes I wish I had enough friends that the loss of a particularly good one didn't mean that much, but unfortunately this is not the case. Perhaps with you it is different? 
Peter's dad died last month. Marcia's mom has breast cancer, but seems to be doing OK. She and Tom have moved to Richmond. My girlfriend filed for divorce from her psycho husband. That's the news. Hope to hear from you.
love,
Brian

I tried to send this to you, but it was returned by the post office.

1993
May 28, 1993 – From Brian
Dear Melissa,
I doubt that you give much of a shit anymore, but it looks like I am moving back to Boston in September. I thought it would be nice to let you know. Also, I seem to have become engaged recently, although I am now having some doubts about the idea. I’m having a hard time getting all the events of my life to line up in such a way that it makes sense for me to be with this particular woman forever.
Anyway, here’s the complete text of a letter I tried to send to you last fall. It bounced because I didn’t know your apartment number, but you seem to have moved since then, so I thought maybe I’d try again.
       [See October 20, 1992]
Good letter, don’t you think?

 
June 3, 1993 – From Melissa
Dear Brian, 
I just got your letter, and I mean just. Before I got it I was sitting here at the computer doing a translation of the incuTemp5 skin temperature sensor interface cable (“do not use as a rectal probe”). Then I thought “maybe someone has seen fit to send me a check today,” and I went out to get the mail. There you have the background story. I was surprised you knew the address. I’ve moved twice since you came down here.
Now I am pondering the expression “to give a shit.” I don’t know about giving a shit. I have really thought about this. I don’t mean it to sound the way it sounds. I know you would laugh in my face if I said I did care. That it did get to me. I guess I am the lousiest friend on this earth. I am not saying this for you to feel sorry for me, so don’t worry. Feel free to agree with me.
To tell the truth, I have no idea why my actions are what they are. I know why I didn’t write you. I didn’t write anyone. I didn’t not want to see you. I don’t know why I sent you away when you came, and then never called you, never wrote you, never explained it.
It’s funny what you write about maybe my having enough friends that the loss of one wouldn’t mean anything to me. The truth is, I have no friends. I have two acquaintances here in Monterey – one used to be a sort of a friend. This is basically the new essence of my post-college, post-grad school life. I have let all my friends go. I never bothered to try and make new friends. Since last summer I have been working at home, so that also cut out on all the acquaintances. Work-friends, etc.
Since December 1991 I have been living with Howard. Howard came back from Amsterdam to see me, to be here in Monterey with me. When you came down to see me, he was here. I had just got home from work, and work was murdering me. We went for a run, then were going out to dinner, a planned night out, away from our two roommates. Then you showed up at the door. I guess I can’t take the responsibility of having friends. Of introducing them to each other. I didn’t know how to introduce you and Howard to each other, you to Lisa and Chi-Ho. Didn’t even think about it when you were there. Howard had just arrived. I hardly knew him, actually, though he had come to stay. It’s a long story.
You are tenacious for writing to me. There are so many things I want to tell you, like: why didn’t you give up on me 8 years ago, or after Holly’s wedding, or etc. I am not really going to say these things. I feel like I have no right to tell you anything. I can’t apologize for myself, or explain, or ask you for anything. Helplessness, hopelessness, too late. But then you do write me to tell me you are leaving California. So now I’m not sure what I’m doing, what I should do.
It was a good letter, the one you tried to send last fall. I can’t believe you are engaged. I can believe you are moving back to Boston. That makes sense.
Nothing seems to line up in life. Is your girlfriend going to Boston with you?
I am also leaving CA. Soon, in fact. I guess I was going to send you a card. (I couldn’t imagine sending you a letter now; I figured you would throw it away.) I am moving to Germany, I got offered a job in Dusseldorf. I start at the end of July. I am happy about this but also weirded out as hell. I don’t like Germany too much. It is not so nice to live there. When I live there, I will have even fewer friends. I will, in fact, have no friends. Lately I’ve been thinking about why I always decide to go become an expatriate. For one thing, I have an excuse for not having friends, for not fitting in anywhere. For not having “a life” in the 20th century, late 20s (agewise) sense of the word. No CD player, nice couch, babies, mortgage, etc.
In the past few months I have been doing lots of writing. Poetry, trying to write short stories. This is the only thing I care about, I decided; the only thing I want to care about.
I am selling all my belongings. Except my books. I am not engaged.
I knew that Marcia was pregnant, that Susy was pregnant with twins, that Peter’s father died. My mother tells me these things. Did you see Peter? Do you see Peter? There are lots of questions I could ask you, like how do you like California, etc.
Remember how you always used to tell me “don’t get engaged”? Ironic considering that you have gone and got yourself engaged. I guess it’s strange you don’t sound happier about it.
I don’t know what else to say. One time you told me it was no good having a friend you saw one evening once a year. Things haven’t changed. Have they? I really don’t understand why things work out so arbitrarily. And then things I can influence, that I do have the power to influence, I just can’t. Does this make any sense? I guess you can tell I am not – how do they say in California? – totally centered.
Holly and Dave are coming to visit tomorrow night, and are staying for a week. Holly is also pregnant, almost 5 months. They bought a house in Richmond. Holly is now a successful playwright. They are happy.
I am leaving Monterey in a month. Thank you for writing me. I was a little afraid to open the letter, I must confess. Deeply imbedded guilt on my conscious, but also that hopelessness I mentioned before. This is a terrible way to end a letter, but I don’t know how else to do it.
	Melissa



June 11, 1993 – From Brian (unsent)
Dear Missy,
I returned today from a trip to Boston, and drove right away to the Post Office where they have been holding my mail. As usual, I was unable to prevent myself from imagining that you or someone else dear to me had sent a letter, though I knew it was unlikely. Sometimes one’s hopes bear little relation to one’s experience.
But there was a letter from you. Thank you for summoning the desire, or ignoring your doubts, or whatever it was that allowed you to write me. I hope that, for comparison, you have been ignored this way yourself, because I find it difficult to describe. Is one devastated? No, because life goes on nearly the same as before. But the hurt is very deep and it never seems to quite go away. It sounds clichéd to write it like this, but it is true. I have lived through it several times, not just with you.
Surely you know that nothing is more painful than silence? I’d like to write this on your eyeballs. Please make a note of it if it has not occurred to you before.
Until reading your letter, I had no idea, for instance, that it felt odd for you to send me away that night, as it felt odd for me driving back home. That one piece of information makes it possible for me to picture you again as a person, and not as an emissary from some exotic, inexplicable species. And after Holly’s wedding? Just knowing that you were aware of the effect of your behavior clears up hours I spent wondering if it was all in my head or if something strange actually did happen. These are like little nuggets of sanity to me. Do you know what it’s like to hope that there is some good reason behind such callousness?
I still have the directions you gave me to your (previous) new home in my wallet, because you giving them to me is the last sensible thing that happened between us. Did you find our knowing each other so unappealing that you could not stand to explain things to me? Or perhaps it was actually that you cared for me more than you were comfortable with? I have had both these feelings myself – it was not knowing that was so hard. My imagination went on long tours to both these poles, and everywhere in between.
It’s funny that you mention that I am “tenacious” as though it were a good thing. Maybe one day I will explain to you how I have been down this road several times before with other women. In fact, I am in therapy now because my attachment to feelings that should have long ago faded makes it difficult for to accept the real love I do share with Helen. It’s a shame that you are not feeling centered, but I find it hard to accept that as an explanation for this kind of cruelty. Frankly, my impression is that you are so wrapped up in your own personal fear of intimacy that you’ve forgotten that there are other people involved, in which case NOW YOU KNOW. If I were running the country, I would throw you in jail for reckless endangerment, or maybe something really good like “fraudulent betrayal of the heart”. You would have a long time to think about what happened.
I am sorry that you are so unhappy; that you are selling all your possessions and moving to a place you do not like (are you bringing Howard?); that you have no friends and care only about your writing. It’s ironic – nothing you can do will change the way I feel for you, though you seem to be trying your damnedest anyway. Perhaps knowing that there are people like me who love you is some comfort to you. I am afraid that it is merely a fact that you accept with reluctance and do not dwell upon.
To answer your questions: I have not seen Peter since we were in VA after his father’s death, though we have spoken once or twice since then. Helen and I are moving to Boston together. In fact, we worked for the same company in Boston before moving out here, although we did not know each other then. I enjoy California, though I’ll never be much of a Californian – mainly it’s just that I have more of a life here than I did when I left Boston. Our move back feels a little premature, since we are leaving only because the office we worked in here has been shut down. Helen is in Mexico for a month – I think I will feel better about getting married when she comes back.
I would love to see you or hear from you again before you leave, if you are so inclined. You say that you have many things to tell me, but that you do not feel that you have the right to do so. Consider this an invitation to just go right ahead and unburden yourself, though I will understand (more or less) if you demur or do not respond.

This is a better letter than the one I actually sent, but being honest like this made me feel vulnerable, and being vulnerable made me feel like a sucker, and I didn’t want to be a sucker any more.
I kept the directions you gave me in my wallet for many years as a reminder.




June 14, 1993 – From Brian
Dear Missy,
I am nearly unable to respond. Your letter was waiting for me when I returned from a trip to Boston, and I spent the rest of that day writing a reply. But it turned out to be what I was saying to myself, not what I wanted to say to you. There are some things I do want you to know, I just can’t find much of a context to put them in. It hurt, if you’re curious, not to hear from you, especially because of a lot of other experiences I’ve had that have nothing to do with you. Nothing hurts like silence. That’s the main thing you should know. I’d write it on your eyeballs if I could. Please make a note of it if it has not occurred to you before.
Other stuff:
“I feel like I have no right to tell you anything.”
Actually, my position is that you have no right to hold back any relevant detail, but have it your way.
“I can’t apologize for myself,...”
Why not? Apology muscle busted?
“…or explain,…”
Make something up.
“…or ask you for anything.”
Yeah, but do I have anything you’d want?
“I am the lousiest friend on this earth.”
Please...
“Helplessness ,hopelessness, too late.”
Kinda sad, isn’t it? But at least it’s out of your hands this way.
You sound like someone paving the way for continued silence, which, of course, is your right. I just wonder why you’re bothering to butter me up like this if you never plan on speaking to me again.
Sorry, I usually want to kick anyone who makes fun of me when I’m trying to be serious, so I don’t have much of an excuse for my attitude above. Perhaps I’m still a bit angry. I do appreciate your sincerity, even if it is a little content-free. Maybe you’re just wary of confiding much in me?
“You are tenacious for writing to me.” The funny thing is I’m in therapy now ‘cause I’m so tenacious. I can’t seem to let go of anyone who’s fucked me up.
Background info and answers to your questions: I have not seen Peter since we were in VA after his father’s death, though we have spoken once or twice since then. Helen and I are moving to Boston together. In fact, we worked for the same company in Boston before moving out here, although we did not know each other then. I enjoy California, though I’ll never be much of a Californian -- mainly it’s just that I have more of a life here than I did when I left Boston. Our move back feels a little premature, since we are leaving only because the office we worked in here has been shut down. Helen is in Mexico for a month -- I think I will feel better about getting married when she comes back.
I’d love to see or hear from you again before you leave, if you’re so inclined. You can call me here at (408) 725-5836, too.

This is me trying to sound tough instead of vulnerable. Not as effective.




August 23, 1993 – From Brian to USPS (and back)


You left the country without responding. Stalker pro-tip: It turns out that you can write to the post office and they will send you anyone’s forwarding address for a small fee.
October 6, 1993 – From Brian (unsent)
October 6, 1993 
Dear Missy,
My plan is to make this a no bullshit letter. I figure that unless I happen to stumble across something that triggers a response, this is likely to be my last letter to you. It’s a little sad always sending these letters off into the void the way I do, so I think I’m going to stop with this one. I can’t deny, however, that my desire to write to you is as strong as ever, so I’m hoping to wrap it all up in this one pretty package and get it over with. Until I sat down to write this I’d been telling myself that my reason for writing you this time was only to say that I’m about to move to Boston, but I just looked back and noticed that that’s the same excuse I used last time. So I am confronted with the fact that I want to write you simply because I still like the idea of being connected to you a little, even if that connection is so ephemeral that I no longer have any indication that you value it as well.
I wrote to the Monterey postmaster to get your new address, in case you’re wondering. Mostly because I wanted proof that you had actually exiled yourself as you described, but also because it’s just nice to know where you are rather than letting the intervening postal services forward my letters back and forth until they reach you.
Your letters are big news here. None of our moms are able to tell us stuff about you, so we mainly write back and forth saying “have you heard from Missy lately?” or “do you know Missy’s address these days?”. We are pretty much in the dark. I don’t even know who “Howard” is. It’s been four months since your last letter, and I am still pissed off and sad when I read it or think about you at all.
I had forgotten that I used to ask you not to get engaged between our yearly visits. But, to me, it’s not ironic that I am now engaged, but sad that the courage it took for me to tell you, even as obliquely as that, how much I cared for you was completely wasted. I can’t even think about those occasions without feeling my heart constrict, but to you it was just another clever literary moment that endeared me to you. Is it too unsophisticated of me to let you know that I meant it, that I would have done almost anything to turn the squashed little feeling behind the request into a reality? Is it banal to confess that part of the attraction of living in California was that you wouldn’t be too far away? Does it ruin the delicious irony of it all, finally?
If you are impressed by the fact that I didn’t “give up on [you] eight years ago, or after Holly’s wedding, or etc.”, why did you never do anything to prevent It? Until your last letter I didn’t even know that you recognized, for instance, Holly’s wedding as something that might put distance between us. You say that “there are so many things [you] want to tell [me]”, but that, alas, you cannot. What am I to think? That our friendship was so wonderfully sublime that it transcends words? Or that you are so afraid of anything resembling unguarded intimacy that you would rather hurt me than take me into your heart? Please understand that these are not idle questions.
What is ironic is that when love did finally find me, I was almost too busy banging my head against this particular wall to notice. I was convinced that meeting my wife would provide the solution to this problem, but it turns out that even she is unable to shed any light on the issue. I am left with the holes in your letters, and all the other things that never got said, and I can’t make sense of any of it.

Months later, I was still trying to process what happened. Clearly I’m not very good at letting people go. As before, this version of the letter is better than the one I actually sent, but was too honest.

October 8, 1993 – From Brian
Dear Missy,
I’ve been trying to understand your last letter and your move (I almost want to call it a self-imposed exile) overseas. I wish that you would provide more of an explanation, but you seem unable or unwilling. It makes me sad to think of you as you describe yourself in the letter, and I am frustrated by your capitulation to hopelessness. This is not how I remember you, but I guess it’s not really my place to say.
I know that your silence is not intended to have any particular effect on me, but it does tend to concentrate the confusion I feel when I think about you. I have decided to write you this letter mainly as an attempt to make myself feel a little better, though, of course, a reply from you would be nice as well. Just so you know, I would never throw away anything you sent me. I have every letter you’ve ever written to me.
You mentioned in your letter that my tenacity in writing you makes you realize that there are many things you’d like to tell me, but that, somehow, you feel you don’t have the right. It is difficult for me to accept this, especially considering how your inaction over the last several years has affected me. Until I read your letter, for instance, I did not know whether you recognized Holly’s wedding as something that might put distance between us.
I had forgotten that I used to ask you not to get engaged between our quasi-annual visits. Your connection of those requests to my own engagement, and to my doubts regarding it, seems almost deliberately hurtful. Don’t you realize that I probably would have waited for you, had you given me even the smallest indication to do so? It’s already humiliating enough for me to remember the anticipation I felt when I first moved to California. Yet you almost seem to be implying that my engagement constitutes a betrayal of your faith in me, while at the same time you provide no explanation for your own tendency to run hot and cold without warning. This is what I see between the lines when I read just that one paragraph of your letter, but I suppose it is just as likely my own imagination over-heating as anything you intended to convey.
I made the enclosed tape for you, which felt pretty good. I hope you enjoy it. Think of me making it for you when you listen to it.
